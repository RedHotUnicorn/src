# Description 
Why is there no black note between B and C or between E and F? Well, this is a simple sounding question with a not very simple answer. You'll need to be sitting up in your seat for this one!

📌This video is a revised re-upload. I originally uploaded this video in April 2022, but soon realised from the reaction in the comments that I had skimmed over a lot of detail when it came to the major scale and the tones and semitones. This was causing confusion for many viewers so I've now decided to replace that video with this new, updated version. I'm much happier with the explaination in this video. Sorry again for any confusion caused by the original edition. You can still view the original version if you like here: https://youtu.be/r7aQQQsvxho

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=0)~~  in western music we have 12 unique pitch classes 12 notes seven of these notes are named after the first seven letters of the alphabet then we also have these five extra notes shoved in between the seven alphabetical notes these are the black notes these black notes each have two names depending on context they are either the sharp of the note to their left for example C sharp or they are the flat of the note to their right for example d flat but a question that every musician has asked at some point is why is there no black note in this gap or this Gap why is there no B sharp and no e sharp or why is there no C flat or F flat well the first step to understanding why there is no note in these two gaps is to first ask why are there gaps here in the first place if we wanted to we could arrange our 12 notes our 12 standard notes of western music like this with no gaps at all wouldn't this make more sense after all it would make the octave physically narrower so the human hand could play wider intervals wider chords and we 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=69)~~  could still work out which notice which by marking one of them in red like we do on a harp well the reason that we don't arrange our keyboard like this and instead use this familiar layout with the two gaps all comes back to one major part of western music the major scale as you probably know the white notes on the piano actually make a major scale if we play all of the white notes from C to C we get a C major scale and as you may have guessed this is not a coincidence the layout of the keyboard ultimately stems from the major scale and its importance in western music all major scales follow a pattern of tone tone semitone tone tone tone semitone that's literally the gaps between the notes that defines the major scale a semitone is the smallest interval we use in western music and a tone is just two semitones so the short answer for why we don't have a note in this Gap or this Gap is because there is so to speak no note there there's no room to fit another note in the notes C and D for example are a tone apart two semitones 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=138)~~  so there is space in between to fit another note D flat or C sharp same goes for between d and e f and g g and a and between A and B but because E and F are only a semitone apart and B and C are only a semitone apart and the semitone is the smallest interval we use in western music we can't have a note in between enf or between B and C these notes are already as close as possible within our Western system so if we're going to keep the semitone as our smallest interval we don't actually need a note between E and F or B and C but even if western music uses the semitone as its smallest interval from a pitch perspective from a frequency perspective that is still technically space between E and F or B and C to fit another note there are intervals smaller than semitones we just don't commonly use them in western music if we cut the interval of a semitone in half we can get a quarter tone giving us space to fit another note in between these notes these would be what we call half sharps for example we'd have a b half sharp or 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=208)~~  an e half Sharp in fact we could have an extra note between any of the notes on our keyboard not just in these gaps we could have a g half sharp or a d half sharp we could even refer to these notes by different names we could call our B half sharp as C half flat if we wanted to these half sharp or half flat notes are called microtonal notes notes smaller than those that we usually get in western music if you'd like to learn more about micro tonality I've got a whole video on it here however this still doesn't explain why we base the layout of our musical keyboard and musical system around the major scale to find out why western music theory is built around the major scale or we can call with the diatonic scale we need to go back to what is generally considered to be the start of formalized western [Music] plane chart also known as Gregorian chant was the music sung by monks and nuns from at least as early as the 8th Century at this time the music was monophonic meaning it was just Melody no chords one note at a time 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=282)~~  the music was also exclusively diatonic meaning it only used the seven notes of the major scale now to be clear the 12th note chromatic scale that we used today did exist at this time but historically you wouldn't use all 12 notes of the scale in one composition like we might today instead the black notes were effectively alternative versions of notes from the major scale that's why the 12 notes of the keyboard aren't named after the first 12 letters of the alphabet you had your seven main notes a b c d e f g and then you might use an alternative version of one of those notes so the black notes didn't really deserve their own distinct alphabetical note name now as a brief aside you might be thinking if all of this plane chart was just using the seven notes of the major scale and didn't even have any chords surely it all sounded really samey well this is actually where modes come from just because we're limited to the seven diatonic notes the white notes doesn't mean we're stuck in the majors scale we could use a mode of the major 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=345)~~  scale for example if we use all of the white notes but treat a as autonomics note we are now using the aeolian mode the a minor scale or we could treat d isotonic note and we're now singing in D Dorian this is where our idea of modes comes from and is why they're often referred to as the church modes but anyway back to the topic at hand as I was saying the musical system of the time was based around just using seven notes the white notes so when did they start using some notes from Beyond the diatonic scale when did they start using what we would call Black notes well although I just said that Gregorian monks just used the seven diatonic notes they did actually sometimes use one other note they would sometimes swap be natural for B-flat the main reason they did this was to resolve the issue of the tritone between the notes F and B as you might have heard before at this time the tritone was considered an undesirable interval so for example if you were a 10th Century Monk and you'd just written because currently we have a tritone here 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=420)~~  between the note F and the note B so how do we turn this undesirable dissonant tritone into a desirable consonant interval like a perfect fourth or a perfect fifth well by swapping the this is where western music got its first black note with the option to swap be natural for B flat we can now have a nice continent perfect fourth or perfect fifth anywhere in the scale but why did they call this new note B flat well that's largely because this new note wasn't seen as a new addition to the seven pictures but instead was an alternative version of B the monks wouldn't have sung B and B-flat in the same piece of music they would have used one or the other so the piece would still be based on just a set of seven notes so we now have one of our five black notes but how did we wind up with the other four and why only four more well the next Black note that was added was E flat as I mentioned before plane chant was initially monophonic I.E it had no Harmony no chords it was just a single unaccompanied Melody however as early as the 9th century Harmony began 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=504)~~  to be used the earliest example of Harmony was what's called organum this was when the main Melody would be harmonized by another voice simply singing the same Melody but a parallel fifth or fourth below it so for example if we take that Melody that we had before we could add a voice singing a fifth below it like this [Applause] and this is where we encounter the need for an E flat note see here the interval between these two notes the E and the B flat is our old foe the undesirable tritone so to give us a nice perfect fifth below the B flat note here we're going to have to flatten our e giving us our next Splat note E flat so we've now got B flat and we've also got E flat but what about the others well it isn't clear exactly when our other black notes began to be used and of course the practice of Music varied from place to place so it wasn't like there was one big decision made to add new black notes even the addition of the B flat and E flat that we've discussed before would have happened at different times in different places but ultimately 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=584)~~  the reason that the last three black notes were added was due to ever more complex use of Harmony over the coming centuries Harmony would evolve from just two voices moving together like this into full polyphony with various voices moving with their own independent motion now although the tritone was becoming a more acceptable choice of Harmony at this time composers still needed and wanted to be able to build a lovely perfect fourth or perfect fifth above or below any given note so for example if they wanted to have a note a fourth Above This E flat note well they need to use an A flat note so now we have an A flat and of course we also want to have the option to build a perfect fourth Above This note above this a flat note so we're going to need a d flat and now I also want to be able to have a perfect fourth above our d flat note which requires a g flat and furthermore I also want to have the option to have a note a fourth above the G flat note well luckily we don't actually have to add another note this time we already have a 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=649)~~  note a perfect fourth above g flat B so now with this set of five black notes we can actually have a perfect fourth or a perfect fifth above or below any other given note so that's why we only need five black notes they were added in such a way to allow a perfect fifth or perfect fourth to be played above or below any other note on the keyboard and that is why we don't need a note between E and F or a note between B and C because forcing some sort of B Sharp note in between these two notes wouldn't give us access to any perfect intervals like a fourth or fifth it would just introduce a whole bunch of weird micro tonal intervals of course let's not forget that this whole time we've not actually been talking about keyboard music we've been talking about monks singing plane chant but it was this musical system first developed for writing categorizing and arranging plane chart that went on to become the basis of all Western music making and thus the system that instruments like keyboard instruments were built around this 12 note system 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=715)~~  has been around for a long time now the earliest known example of an instrument with a modern chromatic keyboard layout like the one that you would recognize was an organ installed at halberstadt Cathedral Germany in 1361. so by the time that any other keyboard instruments like the harpsichord or the piano were developed this keyboard of 12 notes seven white and five black was already the well-established default and despite the centuries has remained the default ever since now one topic I haven't mentioned so far in this video is temperament put simply for a piece of music to be perfectly in tune to be in what's called just intonation the tuning of each note needs to be able to move and flex as the music is performed which is something that can be done when singing a note for example but not when playing on a fixed tuned instrument like a piano where adjusting the tuning in real time would be impossible now some attempts were made historically to offer alternative tunings of each note on the keyboard to bring your playing closer to just 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=776)~~  intonation some keyboard makers experimented with split keys to offer two different tuning options for the same note But ultimately rather than adding more keys to the keyboard to offer multiple tunings of the same note we settled on a tuning system on a temperament known as 12 tone equal temperament and this is the tuning system that almost all music uses today to find out more about what 12 tone equal temperament is and why Music performed on the piano is not perfectly in tune check out this video I did previously so that's why we don't have a black note here or here we simply don't need these notes but there is still one last thing I'd like to address in this video before the end we've established now why we don't have a B sharp or an e sharp on our piano but we can actually have a B sharp or e sharp on our sheet music for example here in Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata we can see a couple B Sharps [Music] so how are we meant to play these notes where do we find our B Sharp note well B Sharp is actually just another name for 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=850)~~  C natural sharp effectively means just to rise by one semitone so although this note on the keyboard is usually referred to as C in some contexts we can instead refer to it as B Sharp so why do we do this why do we have a B sharp in our sheet music even though it doesn't exist on our keyboard wouldn't it be easier just to call it C if that's what it's actually meant to be well you'd think so wouldn't you but actually based done the way that sheet music is written and the way that accidentals work in sheet music it's actually more practical to describe this note here in Moonlight Sonata as a B Sharp rather than just calling it a c natural let me show you why if we did notate these B Sharps as C Naturals instead we would have to add a natural Mark here because the key signature is making all of the seasonless piece of music C Sharps by default but okay whatever let's put that natural Mark in what's wrong with that well the problem is an accidental like a natural Mark is in effect for the entire bar it doesn't just affect this note it affects every 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=914)~~  note on that line of space until we reach the bar line so by putting this natural Mark here we've now inadvertently made this C here a natural even though it was actually meant to be a C sharp so to fix this we're now going to have to add a sharp to this C but wait there's more just like the natural Mark the sharp we've added or so lasts for the entire bar meaning that it's turned this C that wasn't C natural into a C sharp so now we have to add another natural Mark to undo that sharp so as you can see this has quickly become quite a mess and this is why b-sharps can be useful even though reading the note B Sharp might be a bit jarring at first it's still a better solution than having to read such a mess of accidentals like this we need a name that's witty at first but it seems less funny each time you hear

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=0)~~  в западной музыке у нас есть 12 уникальных классов высоты звука 12 нот, семь из этих нот названы в честь первых семи букв алфавита, затем у нас также есть эти пять дополнительных нот, вставленных между семью алфавитными нотами, это черные ноты, каждая из этих черных нот есть два имени в зависимости от контекста, это либо диез ноты слева от них, например до-диез, либо бемоль ноты справа, например ре-бемоль, но вопрос, который в какой-то момент задавал каждый музыкант: почему  нет черной ноты в этом пробеле или в этом пробеле, почему нет си-диеза и ми-диеза, или почему нет хорошо до-бемоль или фа- бемоль. Первый шаг к пониманию того, почему в этих двух пробелах нет ноты, - это сначала спросить, почему  во-первых, здесь есть пробелы, если бы мы захотели, мы могли бы расположить наши 12 нот, наши 12 стандартных нот западной музыки, вот так, без каких-либо пробелов, разве это не имело бы больше смысла, в конце концов, это сделало бы октаву физически уже, поэтому человек  рука могла бы играть более широкие интервалы, более широкие аккорды, и мы все равно 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=69)~~  могли бы определить, какое из них отметить, отметив один из них красным, как мы это делаем на арфе, а причина того, что мы не располагаем нашу клавиатуру таким образом, а вместо этого используем эту знакомую раскладку с два пробела возвращаются к одной основной части западной музыки: мажорная гамма, как вы, наверное, знаете, белые ноты на фортепиано на самом деле составляют мажорную гамму, если мы сыграем все белые ноты от C до C, мы получим гамму C [ __ ], и как  вы, возможно, догадались, что это не совпадение: раскладка клавиатуры в конечном итоге связана с мажорной гаммой, и ее важность в западной музыке все мажорные гаммы следуют схеме тона тон полутон тон тон тон полутон, который буквально представляет собой промежутки между нотами, которые определяют  мажорный масштаб: полутон — это наименьший интервал, который мы используем в западной музыке, а тон — это всего два полутона, поэтому краткий ответ на вопрос, почему у нас нет ноты в этом пробеле или в этом пробеле, заключается в том, что там, так сказать, нет никакой 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=130)~~  ноты, там нет  нет места для размещения другой ноты в нотах C и D, например, разница в тон составляет два полутона, поэтому между ними есть пространство, чтобы разместить другую ноту D-бемоль или C-диез. То же самое происходит между d и e f и g g и a, а также между A и  B, но поскольку расстояние между E и F составляет всего лишь полутон, а расстояние между B и C составляет всего лишь полутон, а полутон — это наименьший интервал, который мы используем в западной музыке, мы не можем иметь ноту между enf или между B и C, эти ноты  уже настолько близко, насколько это возможно в нашей западной системе, поэтому, если мы собираемся сохранить полутон как наш наименьший интервал, нам на самом деле не нужна нота между E и F или B и C, но даже если западная музыка использует полутон как наименьший интервал  интервал с точки зрения высоты тона с точки зрения частоты, который по-прежнему технически представляет собой пространство между E и F или B и C, чтобы соответствовать другой ноте, есть интервалы меньшие, чем полутона, мы просто не часто используем 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=192)~~  их в западной музыке, если мы сокращаем интервал  полутон пополам мы можем получить четверть тона, давая нам место для размещения еще одной ноты между этими нотами, это будет то, что мы называем полудиезами, например, у нас будет полудиез си или полудиез ми, на самом деле у нас может быть дополнительная нота  между любыми нотами на нашей клавиатуре, не только в этих промежутках, мы могли бы использовать полудиез соль или полудиез, мы могли бы даже называть эти ноты разными именами, мы могли бы называть нашу полудиез си как полубемоль до, если бы мы захотели использовать эти полудиезы.  острые или полубемольные ноты называются микротональными нотами, ноты мельче, чем те, которые мы обычно получаем в западной музыке. Если вы хотите узнать больше о микротональности, у меня здесь есть целое видео, однако это все еще не объясняет, почему мы  основываем раскладку нашей музыкальной клавиатуры и музыкальной системы на мажорной гамме, чтобы выяснить, почему западная теория музыки построена на мажорной гамме, или мы можем 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=249)~~  позвонить с помощью диатонической гаммы, нам нужно вернуться к тому, что обычно считается началом  формализованная западная [музыка]», также известная как григорианское пение, представляла собой музыку, которую пели монахи и монахини, по крайней мере, с 8-го века. В это время музыка была монофонической, то есть это была просто мелодия, без аккордов, на одну ноту.  В зарубежные времена аккордов, на одну ноту.  В зарубежные времена музыка также была исключительно диатонической, что означает, что в ней использовались только семь нот мажорной гаммы, теперь, чтобы было понятно, хроматическая гамма из 12 нот, которую мы используем сегодня, действительно существовала в то время, но исторически вы не использовали бы все 12 нот мажорной гаммы. масштаб в одной композиции, как мы могли бы сегодня, вместо этого черные ноты были фактически альтернативными версиями нот мажорной гаммы, поэтому 12 нот клавиатуры не названы в честь первых 12 букв алфавита, у вас было семь основных нот a b c de f g и  тогда вы можете использовать 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=317)~~  альтернативную версию одной из этих нот, чтобы черные ноты на самом деле не заслуживали своего собственного алфавитного названия. Теперь, вкратце, вы можете подумать, что вся эта плоская диаграмма просто использует семь нот мажорной гаммы и даже не было никаких аккордов, конечно, все это звучало очень одинаково, ну, на самом деле, отсюда и появились лады только потому, что мы ограничены семью диатоническими нотами, белые ноты не означают, что мы застряли в мажорной гамме  мы могли бы использовать лад мажорной гаммы, например, если мы используем все белые ноты, но рассматриваем а как автономную ноту, мы сейчас используем эолийский лад, минорную гамму, или мы могли бы обработать изотоническую ноту d и теперь поем в  D Дориан, отсюда и зародилось наше представление о ладах, и именно поэтому их часто называют церковными ладами, но в любом случае вернемся к рассматриваемой теме, поскольку я говорил, что музыкальная система того времени была основана на использовании всего лишь семи нот.  белые ноты, так когда они начали использовать некоторые ноты из-за пределов 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=376)~~  диатонической гаммы, когда они начали хорошо использовать то, что мы бы назвали черными нотами, хотя я только что сказал, что григорианские монахи просто использовали семь диатонических нот, они на самом деле иногда использовали еще одну ноту, которую они использовали  иногда замена си -бемоль естественна, основная причина, по которой они это сделали, заключалась в том, чтобы решить проблему тритона между нотами F и B, как вы, возможно, слышали раньше, в то время тритон считался нежелательным интервалом, поэтому, например, если вы Монах 10-го века, и вы только что написали потому что в настоящее время у нас здесь есть тритон между нотой F и нотой B, так как же нам превратить этот нежелательный диссонансный тритон в желаемый интервал согласных, например, идеальную кварту или идеальную квинту?  заменив здесь западная музыка получила свою первую черную ноту с возможностью замены естественной си-бемоль на си-бемоль, теперь мы можем иметь прекрасный континент, идеальную четвертую или идеальную пятую в любой точке гаммы, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=456)~~  но почему они это сделали?  назовите эту новую ноту си- бемоль, во многом потому, что эта новая нота не рассматривалась как новое дополнение к семи картинкам, а вместо этого представляла собой альтернативную версию си-бемоль, монахи не пели бы си-бемоль и си-бемоль в одном и том же фрагменте.  музыку они бы использовали ту или другую, так что пьеса по- прежнему будет основана только на наборе из семи нот, и теперь у нас есть одна из наших пяти черных нот, но как мы получили остальные четыре и почему только четыре, а лучше  Следующая черная нота, которая была добавлена, была ми-бемоль, как я уже упоминал ранее, плоское пение изначально было монофоническим, то есть в нем не было ни гармонии, ни аккордов, это была просто одна мелодия без аккомпанемента, однако уже в 9 веке начала использоваться гармония. Самый ранний пример гармонии был  то, что называется органумом, это когда основная Мелодия гармонизировалась другим голосом, просто поющим ту же Мелодию, но на параллельную квинту или кварту ниже нее, например, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=518)~~  если мы возьмем ту Мелодию, которая у нас была до того, как мы могли бы добавить голос, поющий на квинту ниже нее.  вот так [Аплодисменты] и здесь мы сталкиваемся с необходимостью в ноте ми-бемоль. Посмотрите здесь, интервал между этими двумя нотами: ми-бемоль и си-бемоль — наш старый враг, нежелательный тритон, поэтому мы должны дать нам прекрасную идеальную квинту ниже си. здесь нам придется сгладить нашу ми, что даст нам следующую сплат-ноту ми-бемоль итак, теперь у нас есть си-бемоль, и у нас также есть ми-бемоль, но что насчет остальных, ну, это не так  ясно, когда именно начали использоваться наши другие черные ноты, и, конечно, музыкальная практика различалась от места к месту, поэтому не было принято одно важное решение о добавлении новых черных нот, даже добавлении си-бемоль и ми-бемоль.  то, что мы обсуждали ранее, могло произойти в разное время в разных местах, но в конечном итоге причина добавления последних трех черных нот заключалась в еще более сложном использовании Гармонии в течение следующих столетий. Гармония развилась бы из 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=593)~~  двух голосов, движущихся вместе, как  теперь это превратилось в полную полифонию с различными голосами, движущимися собственными независимыми движениями, хотя тритон становился более приемлемым выбором гармонии, в то время композиторы все еще нуждались и хотели иметь возможность построить прекрасную идеальную кварту или идеальную квинту выше или ниже любого заданного  обратите внимание, например, если они хотят, чтобы нота была четвертой выше этой ноты ми-бемоль, им нужно использовать ноту ля-бемоль, поэтому теперь у нас есть ля- бемоль, и, конечно же, мы также хотим иметь возможность построить идеальную кварту выше.  Эта нота над этой нотой — бемоль, поэтому нам понадобится ре-бемоль, и теперь я также хочу иметь идеальную кварту над нашей нотой ре-бемоль, для которой требуется соль-бемоль, и, кроме того, я также хочу иметь возможность иметь  обратите внимание на кварту выше ноты соль-бемоль, к счастью, на этот раз нам не нужно добавлять еще одну ноту, у нас уже есть нота на идеальную кварту выше соль-бемоль си, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=653)~~  так что теперь с этим набором из пяти черных нот мы действительно можем получить идеальную кварту  или идеальная квинта выше или ниже любой другой заданной ноты, поэтому нам нужно только пять черных нот, они были добавлены таким образом, чтобы можно было играть идеальную квинту или идеальную кварту выше или ниже любой другой ноты на клавиатуре, и это  почему нам не нужна нота между E и F или нота между B и C, потому что установка какой-то ноты си-диез между этими двумя нотами не даст нам доступа к каким-либо идеальным интервалам, таким как кварта или квинта, а просто  ввести целую кучу странных микротональных интервалов, конечно, давайте не будем забывать, что все это время мы на самом деле не говорили о клавишной музыке, мы говорили о монахах, поющих песнопения самолетов, но именно эта музыкальная система была впервые разработана для записи, категоризации и аранжировка плоской диаграммы, которая впоследствии стала основой всего западного музыкального творчества, и, таким образом, система, в которой такие инструменты, как клавишные,

Раскладка клавиатуры, подобная той, которую вы узнали, была на органе, установленном в Хальберштадтском соборе в Германии в 1361 году. Таким образом, к тому времени, когда были разработаны другие клавишные инструменты, такие как клавесин или фортепиано, эта клавиатура из 12 нот, семи белых и пяти черных, уже была устоявшееся значение по умолчанию, и, несмотря на столетия, с тех пор оно остается значением по умолчанию. Одна тема, которую я до сих пор не упомянул в этом видео, - это темперамент, проще говоря, для того, чтобы музыкальное произведение было идеально настроено, чтобы быть в так называемой просто интонационной настройке.  каждая нота должна иметь возможность двигаться и изгибаться во время исполнения музыки, что можно сделать, например, при пении ноты, но не при игре на фиксированно настроенном инструменте, таком как фортепиано, где регулировка 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=765)~~  настройки в реальном времени была бы невозможна. сейчас это невозможно, исторически предпринимались попытки предложить альтернативные настройки каждой ноты на клавиатуре, чтобы приблизить вашу игру к простой интонации, некоторые производители клавишных экспериментировали с разделенными клавишами, чтобы предложить два разных варианта настройки для одной и той же ноты. Но в конечном итоге вместо того, чтобы добавлять больше клавиш к  клавиатура, предлагающая несколько настроек одной и той же ноты, мы остановились на системе настройки на темпераменте, известной как 12-тоновая равнотемперированная, и это система настройки, которую сегодня использует почти вся музыка, чтобы узнать больше о том, что такое 12-тональная равнотемперированная и почему  Музыка, исполняемая на фортепиано, не совсем гармонична, посмотрите это видео, которое я снял ранее, поэтому здесь и здесь нет черной ноты, нам просто не нужны эти ноты, но есть еще одна вещь, которую мне бы хотелось  чтобы обратиться к этому видео до конца, мы теперь выяснили, почему у нас нет

В сонате мы видим пару си-диез [музыка], так как же мы должны играть эти ноты, где мы хорошо находим нашу ноту си-диез. Си-диез на самом деле просто другое название для естественного до-диеза, по сути, означает просто подняться на один полутон, поэтому, хотя  эта нота на клавиатуре обычно обозначается как «до», в некоторых контекстах мы можем вместо этого называть ее «си-диез», так почему мы это делаем, почему в наших нотах есть си-диез, хотя на нашей клавиатуре его нет  не проще ли было бы просто назвать это C, если это то, что на самом деле должно быть хорошо, вы бы так подумали, не так ли, но на самом деле это основано на том, как пишутся ноты, и на том, как случайные звуки работают в нотах, это  на самом деле более практично описать эту ноту здесь, в Лунной сонате, как си-диез, а не просто называть ее до-диез, позвольте мне показать вам, почему, если бы мы вместо этого 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN54Y73LlLo&t=891)~~  обозначили эти си-диезы как до-диезы, нам пришлось бы добавить здесь естественную отметку, потому что тональность  подпись делает все внесезонное музыкальное произведение C Sharps по умолчанию, но ладно, давайте поставим эту естественную отметку в том, что не так с этим колодцем, проблема случайна, как и естественная отметка действует для всего такта, она не просто влияет  эта нота влияет на каждую ноту на этой линии пространства, пока мы не достигнем такта, поэтому, поставив здесь эту естественную отметку, мы теперь непреднамеренно сделали эту до здесь естественной, хотя на самом деле она должна была быть до -диезом, поэтому, чтобы исправить это  теперь нам придется добавить диез к этому C, но подождите, есть еще что-то вроде естественного. Отметьте, что диез, который мы добавили, или около того длится весь такт, что означает, что он превратил это C, которое не было C естественным, в До-диез, поэтому теперь нам нужно добавить еще одну натуральную метку, чтобы отменить этот диез, и, как вы можете видеть, это быстро превратилось в
