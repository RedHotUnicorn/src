🤓 LOGSEQ COURSE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Want to learn how to be more effective in Logseq? My course "Logseq Mastery" is now available here 👉🏽 https://www.logseqmastery.com 🙌🏽
If you're struggling to manage all your notes and information across personal, professional and academic life, then this is for you. I've built out a structured approach to mastering Logseq from the bottom-up, so that you don't need to navigate through a mass of disparate YouTube tutorials.
Logseq is a powerful combination of a text editor, an outliner, and a linked-network builder, but there is admittedly a learning curve. The course has a wealth of write-ups, videos and diagrams to smooth your transition and quickly master the set of tools available to you in Logseq.

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=0)~~  hey everybody welcome back to the channel it's been a while since i've posted anything here i've been hard at work on other projects which i'll tell you about later but one of the things that i thought would be useful is as a result of the work that i've been doing on this other project just synthesizing a couple of tips that i think will be very helpful to anyone particularly in the beginning of your log-seek journey these are things that i think become intuitive after a while but to really name them at the beginning is quite helpful so i'm going to be going through 17 tips on how to level up in logseek y17 absolutely arbitrary number i was just going through a couple of things and i thought these are good things so we rounded up to 17. so if you only wanted to see what the 17 tips were well they're all right there so you can just skip ahead or skip this video i haven't done an unscripted video in a very long time so i quite miss the just ad-lib talking to the camera using the notes and and going for it so this is 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=65)~~  what i'm trying to do trying to d i wanted to do this video in one take but i don't think it's gonna be possible i'm trying to reduce the psychological burden that i've built up of posting videos on youtube for whatever reason i think suddenly you start having these like expectations for yourself and perfectionist drive kicks in on other stuff that i've been working on you know there's some need for perfectionism but now it's just youtube and it's just a channel to share knowledge so so that's what i'm doing now just sharing and hopefully you find some benefits in this video or just some great ideas so the first tip over here is when in doubt defaults to the daily journal and this is something that i said in the beginning used to frustrate me and now i see why it is just such a powerful tool it minimizes all the friction of thinking where does this thing go where do i have to put this piece of information you just put it in the daily journal and tag it and then you'll be able to find it later i'm going to speak a little bit about tags 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=120)~~  later but daily journal is really like those a5 notebooks that you used to have with like the calendar calendar dates and you just like write little scribble notes that's how you should treat the daily journal and then when things start crystallizing there or you have projects or whatever that you might need to move then you can move them to another page or you know just link it to that page and be able to find it there we're going to look at that point just now i think a really important thing is learning how log seek is manipulating your text files so for this i'm just going to open up this page on the right so i've opened up the folder where my logoseek database is pointing to and the beauty about log seek that is that it's basically opening up all these text files simultaneously and letting you use the information across them in one powerful integrated environment so i've got loads of text files here well not actually because this isn't really my database i'm showing a demo database but if i go here and i look at this page 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=181)~~  i'm on here now it's 17 tips to develop and log 6 so it's a bit small there but if i open that up in and let me see if i can make that bigger no yes i can look so it's editing my text files on my computer and that's really powerful later on if you want to export things or edit things you don't always have to use logs you can use other programs like vs code like typora lots of other applications use markdown so that's a really powerful feature just to be aware of and as you have your page notes which gets stored in your pages folder your journals get stored in your journals folder so these are all your date files and these are some backups but i'm not going to get into i think a really important thing to get used to is to use pages as nodes of association and not just locations i've got a little baker baker thing there which i'll get to now but this page here 17 tips to level up in logseek is used as a location where i've gone and put all these blocks in and you know it's the file essentially is the product but when using logsy you don't need to 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=277)~~  you know put information in pages all the time you can just link to pages so for instance this i've linked to this project once touching my videos now if i go to that page i can see here that i've got these linked references and i don't have any information in the page i've got this properties thing but that's a relic from something old but what it allows me to do is see these places where i've linked to in my database so instead of putting the information into one stuttering mind videos i'm just linking it as a node and the beauty of that is that i can link things to multiple different nodes and this is why i mentioned the baker baker paradox the baker baker paradox is a psychological phenomenon which says that well it's a group of people are told that a person's surname is baker and another group of people are told that the person's profession is baker a few days later they are asked to remember the word associated with that person so the word was baker and the people who were told that the profession is baker are much more likely to 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=344)~~  remember the word baker and that's because baker has a network of associations in our mind there's the visuals of like the baker standing behind the corner bakery stand making pastries or the smell of bread or the sight of the pastries and the prestige donator or whatever you might get at a bakery now that is building up a network of association but if you have to go and remember that that person's name is baker there's only that one thing that you can locate basically so that's what i talk about like the location model it's like i have to go and look for that thing and there's only one place with logseek and with like this node approach you can add multiple different associations to each block or to your pages to be able to retrieve it through multiple different contexts later okay so tags and backlinks are the same thing but they can impact how you use your files in other applications what do i mean by this when i'm talking about tags i'm talking link here that is doing the exact same thing as double square brackets 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=417)~~  and that's a key thing to take or to be aware of if you're using other applications such as obsidian which looks at tags or treats tags differently as then it treats backlinks so if you're looking for like extensibility across all your programs it's important to be consistent with how you're using backlinks but i like to use tags like concepts and then backlinks for when i'm using it in line so the square brackets when i'm talking about a word um so yeah you know tags and i might say backlinks are the same thing and then i will say what am i talking about compatibility that is a concept that i'm talking about okay so that's just a way that i use it but it's really up to you to decide which one you want to use another thing is that if you are using more than one word in your tag you can say let's say more than one word what did i do there i just said hashtag and then square brackets square brackets and then it formats it as a tag so all those three things are doing the exact same thing this point here leave clues for your 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=497)~~  future self wow um i'm realizing now going back to notes from 2020 and 2021 that i you think you're going to remember but you really don't it's important to either document what you're doing or to you know just add multiple associations that you'll be able to find it later so that's just something that you pick up with time you figure out what works what doesn't work i've developed a system of tags or links that help me to find things quite quickly um just depending on what project they were for or what i'm working on for the future it's just a matter of developing that consistency of tagging things and knowing in what context you're going to use it later so one thing i like to think of is if you're ever sending something to a friend over whatsapp to remember a piece of information you'll add keywords add those keywords in using links or tags that's just a helpful heuristic okay this catch-all tag it's a bit of a strange one but it's a nice way i use the catch-all tag fleeting if i don't know where to put something i'm just putting in my daily 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=567)~~  journal and i don't want to lose it i just say hashtag fleeting and then i know that i'm going to always be able to find that thing later so that is my catch-all tag it's just a big bucket and later or once a week or whatever i go and i look through there and i'm i find the things that are pertinent and i process it into my database and other things eventually the hope is that i'll have workflows for absolutely every little piece of information but for the moment that fleeting works a treat and then i can always come back to those thoughts or blocks later okay this is going to be a little bit of a controversial one but don't use the built-in task management for to-do's so your to-do's are to do doing done and just saying control-enter makes that a to-do that i can then check off but i think that this leaves a lot of people with a lot of to-do's in their database that they never get done so looking back at gtd one of the things there is that you need to have actionable next steps like it's not good enough to just like have a 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=633)~~  project that is like to do this project is to do all projects are to do so what i like to do is to do is to use the brackets or double backlinks backlog so i've got this huge backlog that then i can then filter down and say this is now to do and my to-do list is only like 10 or 15 blocks but the backlog allows me to go and find all those things and then re-prioritize them if i want so i'm not losing them but i don't have this like endless list of to-do's that are just showing up everywhere in my database so let's just hashtag backlog or square brackets backlog learning to use keyboard shortcuts it sounds like a simple trivial thing but it really does unlock a lot of speed and fluidity and just ease of working with the program and just makes it much more joyful so i've got some downloads which you can access which show you all the different shortcuts or all the ones that i think are most useful there's also an older video some of the shortcuts have changed so just be aware of that if you do go and watch that older video which i'll 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=696)~~  link to but something which is just very beneficial is to be able to open up your sidebars quickly so i want to be able to navigate and i use my left sidebar tl is a shortcut there okay great then i can use this to go and navigate to different pages i can close that and i want to be able to work in multiple different places so i open my right sidebar so then i say tr that opens my right sidebar okay it's currently empty but i'm suddenly working on this thing and i have a random thought where the heck do i put it alt shift j and that opens up my daily journal and i can just drop in this random thing to remember random thing to remember and then hashtag feeding because i don't need to remember for right now so that's just you know a really helpful trick to have different spaces that you can access very very quickly but i mean there's so many different things that you can do you can you know from a search perspective and navigation control k opens up your search bar and allows you to you know go and search different things very quickly so say 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=764)~~  test i don't know what have i got here a test um that's an old video and i can open it saying enter or i can open the right side by saying shift enter and that's you know really just a nice way to quickly navigate and open up different things so yeah i've basically spoken about the next part here which is using the sidebars really helpful to get all these different spaces and log c to work for you because as i said earlier it's all just text files but it's simultaneously got all those text files in your folders open so all that information is at your fingertips okay so we are talking about indenting your blocks so this is super important and when information belongs together it must be indented otherwise like the information doesn't see each other okay so let's go step back here all of these blocks are in this page so that's okay but if i open up my daily journal and i'm talking about this project so some projects that i'm talking about project b let's go there and then i start entering information about project e this thing 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=839)~~  needs to be done great and i carry on answering this block does does not have any awareness of that block and vice versa like there's no relationship between them they're just next to each other so you've got to treat your indentation as almost like a mini folder that's one way of thinking about it so this block here belongs to project b okay cool now i can start writing in there what keyboard shortcut i use there i used tab and then shift tab to unindent so tab and shift tab really important and also to be able to move things up and down it's alt shift up and alt shift down very useful to be able to move things quickly in your database without using the drag and drop although you can drag and drop and that's also fun too so we're talking about indentation another helpful trick is to go into your plugins so open your settings turn on developer mode it's not that scary and then there's this helpful plugin here called bullet threading and that gives you those lines which show the inheritance of the blocks okay so now if i go to project b and i'm 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=915)~~  just jumping around a little bit here if i go to project b and i look for linked references this block shows up this thing needs to be done blocked there shows up there because it's indented underneath so i've put it in the project b folder now if i shift tab it nothing goes away so if i go back to my page and then i'm going to go alt left i'm going to look here at everything that's under draft now this is a this is one of those ones which is a little bit tricky to grasp in the beginning i'm going to open that draft in the right sidebar now saying shift click and you can see here that i've got the link reference which is the page it's the pages link there but all these blocks don't appear there because they're not indented so if i indent here so tab you'll see now that that block will show up so it's very important if you've got like a header block or whatever in a page and you've got tags that you wanting blocks in that page to show up under to indent them underneath that first block that's something that i think i learned the hard way 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=987)~~  so yeah indenting your blocks when information belongs together think of your block blocks as folders and the other way to think of your block is when you ex or to think about indenting is when you're expanding upon the information in the block so here i'm wanting to talk a little bit more and this is the concept of outlining it just allows you to very quickly structure information put things where they belong group these things together you know i'm saying i'm denting your blocks when information belongs together it's super important and yeah this is now basically a mini folder that i've put this information in and i can collapse that i can go into that block and focus in on that block just by clicking on the bullet so yeah lots of things that we're just looking through very quickly here i have decided that i'm not going to try and make the most structured approaches for youtube because it just takes forever the course that i've been building which i'll say a bit more about that's much more structured okay so cleaning up your pages with some 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1056)~~  markdown headings what does this mean so i'm going to bring this page up onto the right to reference it so shift click on that page there and there we go i've got my my script there and then i'm going to go to my journal page i can click on that button there or i can go gj and there we go there's my daily journal page but this is the page that i want to look at yet so i just want to focus on this page and these are all the quotes that i have from some of the stuff that i did yesterday let's see okay this looks safe and it's just a bit messy though like i don't know what i need to do here it's not nice to interact with so what i do is i just collapse this all to it collapses everything and then i've got these shortcuts which bring in markdown headers so i'm just going to type them out though so content is one of them content and then i can indent this video here which is a very interesting video by michael ashcroft this is a quote so that's also content and then this is some article that i read so i can drag and drop that let's 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1130)~~  see why is that no go back that's just alt and left and then drag that there drag that there i can also use shortcuts okay cool so there's all my content and then i can just collapse that and boom gone the other one that i use is reminders and i'll just use a shortcut well it's a it's not a shortcut let me type it out reminders and things like you know to do's or whatever gets stuck in there so to read goes in there to read also goes in there so i had actually lots of different things there there we go so these are all my two read things there and and looking at these two reads i'll go to them now and then a lot of things that i've got fleeting you can see i love my fleeting is my scratch pad scratch pad and i'll just indent all of these underneath my scratch pads and there we go that one also belongs here and now i can collapse that and my day is starting to look a lot more manageable and the other one that i have okay i use a text expander i've spoken about in other videos but i just say jjm and that's meeting conversations and then 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1207)~~  what's the other one um not looking for me oh jjw is what i worked on so nothing really here but i have this you know chatted to this person about autism and this one can go in scratch pad great and there's my day sorted and i've gone and retrofitted many of my days that um anytime that i'm like looking for something in my database and i find a day that's like not sorted i go and i look and i'm like okay i can delete some of this information or i can clean it up it just makes it so nice to go back and find it later and it gives you a little bit more order in your database okay so what was i saying are there reminders you can see here when i'm talking about something to read going back to the idea of using a page as a node i don't go to the to read page and then add this book i simply use the tag to read and then i add the book's name but if i go to that page now to read you can see here that all the books that i want to read have been referenced and then if i so chose to do it i could move them into the actual file so i could just do that 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1279)~~  very simply just dragging and dropping that spatial feature is very nice okay so this is the idea of using it as nodes where i'm not actually going to the to read file to put things in i just build the association and i can you know arrange things later okay let's go back to alt left and back again and back again where we okay here we are so what i'm now saying is learn how to use properties now properties seem scary but they really are a very useful feature so where links are just like saying these two things are related properties are adding more meaning to those two things so it's saying it's like defining the type of relationship and this helps you in your queries and finding information easier later down the line so let's open up yesterday's page alt shift j on the right again and um no that's not what we want what i want i'm just going to use this plugin here and i'm going to open up yesterday's page great and let's have a look at content and there we go so i'm gonna i can shift click on this block here the subtle signs of over functioning 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1352)~~  and there we go so these oops okay so i'm actually just going to open this block here and i'm going to close this so what you can see here is i'm not actually opening the page i'm opening a block and the block can function as a folder because of indenting so it's like yeah it's inception basically i mean look i've got my page and then i've got my block content which functions as a bit of a folder and then you know all these different articles and then i can click in and focus in on that one article so this is you know my article templates i have the who's the producer what is the type i've got the link there so i can quickly find it and then tags over functioning so i know if i want to find anything in my database about over-functioning i can quickly go and find it later and here we go just some advice on over-functioning okay so this is what i wanted to talk about is the properties and you can see there that it's all in one block so that means that i can find this article in a number of different ways i can either say you know control k and let me 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1428)~~  say article and then i can go hmm okay cool article i'm searching the articles in the link references and i'm wanting to look for articles by the same person so i go there to my filter and this faults i think it's not the greatest at the moment it needs to be sorted after basically they're asking there's a feature request to do that and where am i going i'm looking for the anxious overachiever there great now because i've got those multiple nodes in one block i can find that very easily using my filters okay so learn how to use properties it's very very useful okay now the next point going back back back let me go sidebar again tl and then i can just go here to my recent pages there we go 17 steps two types to level up so i'm just going to close that again so using templates so templates are you know a feature that allow you to add information very quickly so let's see if i've actually got any templates in here so i'm going to say forward slash templates and yes i do i've got crumbs as the template that i used to use oh that's old um 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1508)~~  i need to change that let's change it now so what i can do is i can go to my templates page templates and there's my template crumbs but i i used to use this headline thing but i don't use that anymore i just use three markdown headers to ensure to so that i know that i can put the title there and i don't say create anymore i say because that's more generic okay so that's my crumbs templates i've just gone and changed that in my templates page so when i'll go back to where i was alt left and then i say delete this block here and then forward slash templates and then i go to crumbs and i can enter the information here this article let's say it's the anxious overachiever and that's an article etc so it's also a very good forcing mechanism to make sure that i'm processing all my inputs because it's easy to be lazy and not do that and then you won't be able to find that later okay so to make a template you can let's try another one here where i can say oopsie i'm going to leave this thing like that and that's a shift enter to do a soft 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1596)~~  line break so that stays in one block that's important for that and then i'm going to right click on that and i'm going to say make templates and i'm going to make that an article template so i go there now and i do the same thing let's go underneath here and then i indent it's just there's a real purpose there that's not good practice i'm sorry i'm supposed to say forward slash templates and i say article okay there we go so there are my two blocks and i'm just going to depose okay so namespaces namespaces are a way that you can add hierarchy in your database if you like the folders approach you know if you're using windows you start with my computer c drive for whatever files and folders you're going into with log seek you can do a similar thing and i think my projects yes they do okay so if i go to projects i can see here if i close link references then i've got this nice set of you know folders broken down here but it's not a folder in the traditional sense like i'm not really putting information in that so you know this 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1679)~~  here one's touching mine what's yeah it's empty again i'm just pointing two things and that's one thing to remember that it's not actually like you can use it to put information in there like in the actual or blocks in the page so i can go and say but i'd like to use them as nodes for some of my projects i will have like a manifesto like what i want to achieve what the objectives are but for this i don't really do that and that would that would be in the page the manifesto etc okay so the one thing though is it does whoopsie don't know what's happening there zoom in again control shift plus okay so going back and back cool so namespaces give you that extra ability to navigate easily to your database but there can be a bit of a shape to maintain okay backing up your files so earlier we saw all my my all my database which is the set of files here now i don't have a very sophisticated backup mechanism there are some people who have very good ones check out tools on tech i think he uses git if you're interested in like a really robust backup system

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1837)~~  you're on an older version you really are missing out like the latest versions are schlick they're getting there um so to do that it's your settings menu there we go someone asked if i can do more of that and i completely forgot in this video but the what am i looking for oh yeah settings and there we go check for updates i'm on the latest version so that's okay so if there's an updates available it will download it and then you can install the update okay so the last point here don't be lacker what is this about this is not about log seek at all well it is i recently went to africa burn and this is one of the mottos of africa burn when you get there you know it's a community vibe you the whole idea is to be the best version of yourself not be why does this make an appearance in here so i think one of the things that i've observed just like from being on the periphery of the forums because i'm not you know active and answering questions is that sometimes people come in and they're quite entitled and it really doesn't make any sense to me like this

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1979)~~  okay so i'm gonna stop being preachy now this is uh 17 tips just to level up in log seek you know especially if you're beginning or especially if you're starting the journey i know that i went through some things and it was a bit unstructured if you're looking for a structured approach that is going to be in log seek mastery log seek mastery is what i've been working on for the past few months it's becoming a bit of a behemoth but i'm finally going to be releasing like the tutorials version of logseek mastery out of beta in the very near future so have a look at that it's much more structured there's a lot of visual aids to go through it and videos and text and diagrams it's all there there's a second component to that which is log seek mastery workflows and systems and that's the really exciting thing and that's still going to take a little bit of a while to develop because there's a few videos that i'll need to produce here first just to like test the water so for instance research workflows there's so many ideas but not enough time in the

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=0)~~  Привет всем, добро пожаловать обратно на канал, я давно ничего здесь не публиковал. Я усердно работал над другими проектами, о которых расскажу вам позже, но одна из вещей, которая, как мне кажется, была бы полезна, — это результат работы, которую я проделывал над этим другим проектом, просто обобщил пару советов, которые, я думаю, будут очень полезны для всех, особенно в начале вашего путешествия по поиску журналов, это вещи, которые, я думаю, станут интуитивными через некоторое время  но по -настоящему назвать их в начале очень полезно, поэтому я собираюсь рассмотреть 17 советов о том, как повысить уровень в logseek. y17 абсолютно произвольное число. Я только что прошел через пару вещей и подумал, что это хорошие вещи, так что  мы округлили до 17. так что, если вы хотите только увидеть, что это за 17 советов, они все в порядке, так что вы можете просто пропустить вперед или пропустить это видео, я очень давно не делал видео без сценария, поэтому я  очень скучаю по простому импровизированному разговору с камерой, используя 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=63)~~  заметки и стремясь к этому, вот что я пытаюсь сделать, пытаюсь сделать, я хотел сделать это видео за один дубль, но не думаю, что это будет возможно  я пытаюсь уменьшить психологическую нагрузку, которую я накопил, публикуя видео на YouTube, по какой-то причине, я думаю, внезапно у вас начинаются такие же ожидания от себя, и перфекционистский драйв проявляется в других вещах, над которыми я работал над вами  знаю, что есть некоторая потребность в перфекционизме, но сейчас это просто YouTube, и это просто канал для обмена знаниями, поэтому я сейчас просто делюсь ими, и, надеюсь, вы найдете в этом видео какую-то пользу или просто несколько отличных идей, поэтому первый совет здесь.  это когда есть сомнения, по умолчанию используется ежедневный журнал, и это то, что я сказал в начале, раньше меня расстраивало, и теперь я понимаю, почему это такой мощный инструмент, он сводит к минимуму все трения мышления, куда эта штука идет, куда мне  нужно поместить эту информацию, просто поместите ее в ежедневник и пометьте ее, а затем 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=117)~~  вы сможете найти ее позже. Я собираюсь немного поговорить о тегах позже, но ежедневник действительно похож на те блокноты формата А5.  то, что у вас раньше было, например, календарные даты, и вам просто нравится писать небольшие заметки, вот как вы должны относиться к ежедневному журналу, а затем, когда там что-то начинает выкристаллизовываться, или у вас есть проекты или что-то еще, что вам, возможно, придется переместить, тогда вы можете двигаться  их на другую страницу, или вы знаете, просто свяжите его с этой страницей и сможете найти его там, мы собираемся посмотреть на этот момент прямо сейчас, я думаю, что действительно важная вещь - это узнать, как поиск журнала манипулирует вашими текстовыми файлами, поэтому для этого  я просто собираюсь открыть эту страницу справа, чтобы открыть папку, на которую указывает моя база данных logoseek, и красота поиска по журналам заключается в том, что он по сути открывает все эти текстовые файлы одновременно и позволяет вам использовать  информация в них находится в одной мощной интегрированной среде, поэтому у 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=171)~~  меня здесь много текстовых файлов, ну, на самом деле, нет, потому что это не совсем моя база данных, я показываю демонстрационную базу данных, но если я зайду сюда и посмотрю на эту страницу, я  Я здесь, сейчас 17 советов по разработке и регистрации 6, так что там он немного мал, но если я открою это в и позволю себе посмотреть, смогу ли я увеличить его, нет, да, я смогу, посмотрите поэтому он редактирует мои текстовые файлы на моем компьютере, и это очень полезно в дальнейшем, если вы хотите что-то экспортировать или редактировать, вам не всегда нужно использовать журналы, вы можете использовать другие программы, такие как vs code, такие как typora, которые используют многие другие приложения.  уценка, так что это действительно мощная функция, о которой просто нужно знать, и поскольку у вас есть заметки на страницах, которые хранятся в папке ваших страниц, ваши журналы хранятся в папке ваших журналов, так что это все ваши файлы с датами, и это некоторые резервные копии, но я  не буду вдаваться в я думаю, что действительно важная 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=250)~~  вещь, к которой нужно привыкнуть, - это использовать страницы как узлы ассоциации, а не просто места. У меня там есть небольшая штука с пекарем, к которой я сейчас перейду, но эта страница здесь 17 советов по повышению уровня в logseek используется как место, куда я пошел и поместил все эти блоки, и вы знаете, что файл, по сути, является продуктом, но при использовании logsy вам не нужно знать, что нужно размещать информацию на всех страницах. время, когда вы можете просто ссылаться на страницы, например, это я связал с этим проектом, как только коснулся своих видео, теперь, если я перейду на эту страницу, я увижу здесь, что у меня есть эти связанные ссылки, и у меня нет никакой информации  на странице у меня есть эта штука со свойствами, но это пережиток чего-то старого, но она позволяет мне видеть те места, на которые я ссылаюсь, в моей базе данных, поэтому вместо того, чтобы помещать информацию в одно заикающееся мысленное видео, я  Я просто связываю его как узел, и прелесть этого в том, что я могу связать вещи с несколькими разными узлами, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=316)~~  и именно поэтому я упомянул парадокс пекаря-пекаря Парадокс пекаря-пекаря — это психологический феномен, который говорит, что это группа людей, сказали, что фамилия человека — пекарь, а другой группе людей сообщили, что профессия этого человека — пекарь, через несколько дней их попросили вспомнить слово, связанное с этим человеком, поэтому слово было «пекарь», и людей, которым сказали, что эта профессия  « пекарь» с гораздо большей вероятностью запомнит пекарь» с гораздо большей вероятностью запомнит слово «пекарь», и это потому, что «пекарь» имеет в нашем сознании сеть ассоциаций: например, пекарь, стоящий за угловым прилавком пекарни и готовящий выпечку, или запах хлеба, или вид выпечки, и  престижный жертвователь или что-то еще, что вы можете получить сейчас в пекарне, которая создает сеть ассоциаций, но если вам нужно пойти и вспомнить, что этого человека зовут пекарь, то в основном вы можете найти только одну вещь, вот о чем я говорю, например  модель местоположения, как будто мне нужно пойти и поискать эту вещь, и 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=380)~~  есть только одно место с поиском журнала, и с помощью такого подхода к узлу вы можете добавить несколько разных ассоциаций к каждому блоку или на ваши страницы, чтобы иметь возможность получать его через несколько разных контекстов  позже, окей, теги и обратные ссылки — это одно и то же, но они могут повлиять на то, как вы используете свои файлы в других приложениях, что я имею в виду, когда говорю о тегах, о которых говорю, которая делает  то же самое, что и двойные квадратные скобки, и это ключевой момент, который следует учитывать или знать, если вы используете другие приложения, такие как obsidian, которые смотрят на теги или обрабатывают теги по-другому, а затем обрабатывают обратные ссылки, поэтому, если вы ищете  как и в случае с расширяемостью всех ваших программ, важно соблюдать единообразие в том, как вы используете обратные ссылки, но мне нравится использовать теги, такие как концепции, а затем обратные ссылки, когда я использую их в строке, поэтому квадратные скобки, когда я говорю о слове хм, да, вы знаете теги, и я мог бы сказать, что 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=452)~~  обратные ссылки - это одно и то же, а затем я скажу я говорю о совместимости, это концепция, о которой я говорю, окей, это просто способ, которым я ее использую но на самом деле вам решать, какой из них вы хотите использовать. Другое дело, что если вы используете более одного слова в своем теге, вы можете сказать, скажем, более одного слова, что я там сделал, я просто сказал хэштег, а затем квадрат  скобки квадратные скобки, а затем он форматирует их как тег, так что все эти три вещи делают одно и то же, этот момент здесь оставляет подсказки для вашего будущего себя, вау, я понимаю, сейчас возвращаюсь к заметкам за 2020 и 2021 годы, о которых вы думаете  вы запомните, но на самом деле это не так, важно либо документировать то, что вы делаете, либо просто добавить несколько ассоциаций, которые вы сможете найти позже, так что это просто то, что вы подберете со временем  вы выясняете, что работает, что не работает. Я разработал систему тегов или ссылок, которые помогают мне находить вещи довольно быстро, просто в зависимости 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=529)~~  от того, для какого проекта они были или над чем я работаю в будущем, это просто вопрос в том, чтобы выработать согласованность в тегировании вещей и знать, в каком контексте вы собираетесь использовать их позже, поэтому мне хотелось бы подумать об одной вещи: отправляете ли вы когда-нибудь что-нибудь другу через WhatsApp, чтобы запомнить часть информации, которую вы  я добавлю ключевые слова добавлю эти ключевые слова при использовании ссылок или тегов, это просто полезная эвристика, окей, этот всеобъемлющий тег, это немного странно, но это хороший способ использовать мимолетный всеобъемлющий тег, если я не знаю, куда  поместите что-то, что я просто помещаю в свой ежедневный журнал, и я не хочу это потерять, я просто говорю, что хэштег мимолетный, и тогда я знаю, что всегда смогу найти эту вещь позже, так что это моя уловка  отметьте, что это просто большое ведро, и позже, или раз в неделю, или что-то еще, я хожу, просматриваю там и нахожу подходящие вещи, обрабатываю их в своей базе данных и другие вещи, в конечном итоге надеюсь, что я 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=588)~~  у меня есть рабочие процессы абсолютно для каждой маленькой порции информации, но на данный момент мимолетность работает очень приятно, и тогда я всегда могу вернуться к этим мыслям или блокам позже, окей, это будет немного спорный вопрос, но не используйте встроенное управление задачами для задач, поэтому ваши задачи состоят в том, чтобы сделать, и просто сказать, что Control-Enter делает это делом, которое я затем могу отметить, делает это делом, которое я затем могу отметить, но я думаю, что это оставляет много людей с большим количеством людей  дел в их базе данных, которые никогда не выполняются, поэтому, оглядываясь назад на gtd, одна из вещей заключается в том, что вам нужно иметь действенные следующие шаги, как будто недостаточно просто иметь проект, который похож на этот проект, делать все проекты - это делать, поэтому мне нравится использовать скобки или резервную копию двойных обратных ссылок, поэтому у меня есть огромное количество невыполненной работы, которую затем я могу отфильтровать и сказать, что это сейчас нужно сделать, и мне нужно 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=651)~~  -список дел состоит всего из 10 или 15 блоков, но журнал невыполненной работы позволяет мне найти все эти вещи, а затем изменить их приоритетность, если я захочу, поэтому я не теряю их, но у меня нет такого бесконечного списка дел, которые нужно выполнить. -do, которые просто появляются повсюду в моей базе данных, так что давайте просто отставать по хештегам или квадратным скобкам. отставать по хештегам или квадратным скобкам. Научимся использовать сочетания клавиш. Это звучит как простая тривиальная вещь, но на самом деле это открывает большую скорость и плавность, а также простоту работы с  программа и просто делает ее намного более радостной, поэтому у меня есть несколько загрузок, к которым вы можете получить доступ, которые показывают вам все различные ярлыки или все те, которые я считаю наиболее полезными, есть также старое видео, некоторые ярлыки изменились, так что просто будьте  осознавая это, если вы пойдете и посмотрите это старое видео, на которое я дам ссылку, но кое-что очень полезное - это возможность быстро открывать боковые панели, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=702)~~  поэтому я хочу иметь возможность навигации и использую левую боковую панель, tl  это ярлык, хорошо, отлично, тогда я могу использовать его для перехода к различным страницам, я могу закрыть его, и я хочу иметь возможность работать в нескольких разных местах, поэтому я открываю правую боковую панель, а затем говорю tr, что открывает мою правую боковую панель  окей, сейчас он пуст, но я внезапно работаю над этой штукой, и у меня возникает случайная мысль, куда, черт возьми, мне положить это, alt Shift j, и это открывает мой ежедневный журнал, и я могу просто заглянуть в эту случайную вещь, чтобы запомнить случайную вещь, чтобы  запомни, а затем корми хэштегом, потому что мне сейчас не нужно запоминать, так что ты знаешь действительно полезный трюк, позволяющий иметь разные места, к которым вы можете получить доступ очень и очень быстро, но я имею в виду, что есть так много разных вещей, которые вы можете сделать, вы можете  вы знаете, с точки зрения поиска и управления навигацией k открывает панель поиска и позволяет вам очень быстро узнать, идите и ищите 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=762)~~  разные вещи, так что скажите тест, я не знаю, что у меня здесь, тест, хм, это старое видео, и я  я могу открыть его, сказав Enter, или я могу открыть правую сторону, сказав Shift Enter, и это, знаете ли, просто хороший способ быстро перемещаться и открывать разные вещи, так что да, я в основном говорил о следующей части здесь, которая использует боковые панели  очень полезно заставить все эти разные пространства и журнал c работать на вас, потому что, как я сказал ранее, это просто текстовые файлы, но одновременно все эти текстовые файлы в ваших папках открыты, так что вся эта информация у вас под рукой, хорошо, поэтому мы говорим  об отступах ваших блоков, так что это очень важно, и когда информация принадлежит друг другу, она должна быть с отступом, иначе информация не видит друг друга, хорошо, так что давайте вернемся назад, все эти блоки находятся на этой странице, так что все в порядке, но если я открою  Я открываю свой ежедневный журнал и говорю об этом проекте, поэтому некоторые проекты, о которых я говорю, проект 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=832)~~  b, давайте перейдем туда, а затем я начинаю вводить информацию о проекте e, это нужно сделать отлично, и я продолжаю отвечать на этот блок.  не знает об этом блоке, и наоборот, как будто между ними нет никакой связи, они просто находятся рядом друг с другом, поэтому вам придется относиться к своему отступу почти как к мини-папке, это один из способов думать об этом, поэтому этот блок  здесь принадлежит проекту b, окей, круто, теперь я могу начать писать там, какое сочетание клавиш я использую, я использовал вкладку, а затем сдвинул вкладку, чтобы удалить отступ, так что вкладка и вкладка сдвига действительно важны, а также чтобы иметь возможность перемещать элементы вверх и вниз, это альтернативный сдвиг  вверх и alt- сдвиг вниз очень полезны, чтобы иметь возможность быстро перемещать объекты в вашей базе данных без использования перетаскивания, хотя вы можете перетаскивать, и это тоже весело, поэтому мы говорим об отступах. Еще один полезный трюк — зайти в ваши плагины  так что откройте настройки, включите режим разработчика, это не так уж и 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=901)~~  страшно, а еще здесь есть этот полезный плагин, называемый Bullet Threading, и он дает вам те строки, которые показывают наследование блоков, хорошо, так что теперь, если я перейду к проекту b, я просто прыгаю  где-то здесь, если я перейду к проекту b и поищу связанные ссылки, этот блок покажет, что эту вещь нужно сделать, заблокирован там, там появится, потому что он с отступом внизу, поэтому я сейчас поместил его в папку проекта b, если я  вкладка «Shift», ничего не исчезает, поэтому, если я вернусь на свою страницу, а затем перейду влево, я посмотрю здесь все, что сейчас находится в черновике, это один из тех, который немного  немного сложно понять в начале, я собираюсь открыть этот черновик на правой боковой панели, теперь нажимаю Shift, и вы можете видеть здесь, что у меня есть ссылка на ссылку, которая является страницей, там есть ссылка на страницы, но все эти блоки не используются.  не отображаются там, потому что они не имеют отступов, поэтому, если я сделаю отступ здесь, так что вкладка, вы увидите, что этот блок 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=971)~~  появится, поэтому это очень важно, если у вас есть блок заголовка или что-то еще на странице, и вы  есть теги, под которыми вы хотите, чтобы блоки на этой странице отображались, чтобы сделать отступ под этим первым блоком, это то, что, я думаю, я усвоил на собственном горьком опыте, так что да, делая отступы для ваших блоков, когда информация принадлежит друг другу, думайте о своих блоках как о папках и наоборот  думать о своем блоке — это когда вы его делаете, а думать об отступах — это когда вы расширяете информацию в блоке, поэтому здесь я хочу поговорить еще немного об и это концепция его описания. просто позволяет вам очень быстро структурировать информацию, расставлять вещи по местам, группировать эти вещи вместе, вы знаете, я говорю, что я вдавливаю ваши блоки, когда информация принадлежит друг другу, это очень важно, и да, теперь это, по сути, мини- папка, которую я положил  эту информацию, и я могу свернуть, чтобы я мог перейти в этот блок и сосредоточиться на нем, просто щелкнув маркер, так что да, мы очень быстро просматриваем здесь много вещей, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1042)~~  я решил, что не буду  попытаться создать наиболее структурированный подход для YouTube, потому что курс, который я строил, занимает целую вечность, о котором я скажу немного больше, он гораздо более структурирован, хорошо, так что очистите свои страницы с помощью некоторых заголовков с уценкой, что это значит  Итак, я собираюсь поднять эту страницу справа, чтобы ссылаться на нее, поэтому нажмите на эту страницу, удерживая клавишу Shift, и все, у меня там мой сценарий, а затем я перейду на страницу своего журнала, я могу щелкнуть  на этой кнопке или я могу пойти, gj, и вот, вот страница моего ежедневного журнала, но это страница, которую я хочу просмотреть, поэтому я просто хочу сосредоточиться на этой странице, и это все цитаты, которые у меня есть из некоторых  из того, что я сделал вчера, давайте посмотрим, окей, это выглядит безопасно и просто немного беспорядочно, хотя, как будто я не знаю, что мне нужно здесь делать, с этим неприятно взаимодействовать, поэтому я просто сворачиваю все это в него  сворачивает все, а затем у меня 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1107)~~  есть эти ярлыки, которые вводят заголовки уценки, поэтому я просто собираюсь их напечатать, хотя контент является одним из них, а затем я могу сделать отступ для этого видео здесь, это очень интересное видео Майкла Эшкрофта это цитата, так что это тоже контент, а затем это какая-то статья, которую я прочитал, чтобы я мог перетаскивать ее, давайте посмотрим, почему нет возврата назад, это просто Alt и влево, а затем перетащите туда, перетащите туда, я также могу использовать ярлыки окей, круто, там весь мой контент, а потом я могу просто свернуть его, и бум ушел, другое, что я использую, это напоминания, и я просто использую ярлык, ну, это не ярлык, позвольте мне напечатать напоминания и тому подобное, как вы  знаю, что делать, или что-то еще там застревает, поэтому чтение идет туда, чтобы читать также идет туда, так что на самом деле у меня было много разных вещей, вот и мы идем, так что это все мои две прочитанные вещи там, и, глядя на эти два чтения, я  Я буду ходить к ним время от времени, многие вещи, которые у меня 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1180)~~  мимолетны, вы можете видеть, мне нравится мое мимолетие, это мой блокнот, блокнот, и я просто делаю отступы во всем этом под моим блокнотом, и вот, поехали.  также принадлежит здесь, и теперь я могу свернуть это, и мой день начинает выглядеть намного более управляемым, а другой, который у меня есть, в порядке, я использую расширитель текста, о котором говорил в других видео, но я просто говорю jjm, и это разговоры о встречах  а что еще один, эм, не ищет меня, о, черт возьми, это то, над чем я работал, так что здесь ничего особенного, но у меня есть это, вы знаете, болтал с этим человеком об аутизме, и этот можно записать в блокнот, отлично, и вот мой день отсортирован, и я  Я пошел и модернизировал многие свои дни, и каждый раз, когда я ищу что-то в своей базе данных, и нахожу день, который вроде как не отсортирован, я иду, смотрю и думаю, что я могу удалить часть этой информации  или я могу это почистить, просто так приятно вернуться и найти это позже, и это дает вам немного больше порядка в вашей базе данных, хорошо, и что я говорил, есть ли 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1245)~~  напоминания, которые вы можете увидеть здесь, когда я говорю о  что-то почитать, возвращаясь к идее использования страницы в качестве узла. Я не перехожу на страницу чтения, а затем добавляю эту книгу. Я просто использую тег для чтения, а затем добавляю название книги, но если я перейду к ней  Теперь, чтобы прочитать страницу, вы можете видеть здесь, что на все книги, которые я хочу прочитать, были ссылки, и затем, если я захочу это сделать, я мог бы переместить их в реальный файл, чтобы я мог просто сделать это очень просто, просто перетащив это  пространственная функция очень хороша, окей, так что это идея использовать ее в качестве узлов, где я на самом деле не собираюсь читать файл, чтобы вставить что-то, я просто создаю ассоциацию, и, знаете ли, организуйте все позже, окей, давайте вернемся к  alt влево и назад снова и снова назад, где мы в порядке, вот и мы, поэтому я сейчас говорю: научитесь использовать свойства, теперь свойства кажутся пугающими, но на самом деле они очень полезная функция, поэтому ссылки - это все равно, что 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1314)~~  сказать, что эти две вещи  связанные свойства придают больше значения этим двум вещам, поэтому говорится, что это похоже на определение типа связи, и это помогает вам в ваших запросах и облегчает поиск информации в дальнейшем, поэтому давайте снова откроем вчерашнюю страницу alt Shift j справа и хм. нет, это не то, что мы хотим, то, что я хочу, я просто собираюсь использовать этот плагин здесь, и я собираюсь отлично открыть вчерашнюю страницу, и давайте посмотрим на контент, и все готово, так что я собираюсь переместить щелчок  в этом блоке здесь есть тонкие признаки чрезмерного функционирования, и вот мы идем, и вот эти упс окей, на самом деле я просто собираюсь открыть этот блок здесь и закрыть его, так что вы можете увидеть здесь: я не  на самом деле открывая страницу, я открываю блок, и блок может функционировать как папка из-за отступов, так что это похоже на то, что да, это начало, в основном я имею в виду, посмотрите, у меня есть моя страница, а затем у меня есть содержимое блока, которое функционирует как  немного 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnxq3iITAJk&t=1380)~~  папки, и тогда вы знаете все эти разные статьи, а затем я могу щелкнуть мышью и сосредоточиться на этой статье, так что вы знаете мои шаблоны статей, у меня есть кто продюсер, какого типа я  У меня там есть ссылка, чтобы я мог быстро ее найти, а затем отметить функционирование, чтобы я знал, что если я захочу найти в своей базе данных что-нибудь о чрезмерном функционировании, я могу быстро пойти и найти это позже, и здесь мы дадим несколько советов по этому поводу.  - работает нормально, поэтому я хотел поговорить о свойствах, и вы можете видеть, что все это в одном блоке, а это означает, что я могу найти эту статью разными способами.
