 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=0)~~  so over the last 15 years I've tried an enormous number of productivity apps and tools and Tech but in this video I'm going to save you the time and money of having to test all of these yourself and I'm going to share what I think are the best apps and tools and Tech that I actually use every day to stay productive so the first thing I do when I get up in the morning is that I go to the bathroom I do a little Wii and then I weigh myself on my Withings smart scales these are great because they're Wi-Fi enabled and they sync with apple health kit which means I can track how my weight changes over time and this is just incredibly useful it's like what they say what gets measured gets managed then I'll have a shower and change and stuff next I make myself a cup of coffee using a particular Tech item called the clever dripper which is a very nice way to make filter coffee and then I use one of my favorite productivity tools of all time which is a physical pen and paper journal and what I do in this journal is something called morning Pages which is 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=46)~~  a technique from the book the artist's Way by Julia Cameron and essentially the idea is that you write three pages by hand I actually wrote four this morning because I was feeling like I was on a bit of a roll you write three pages by hand of stream of Consciousness whatever comes to mind and I find that this is a great way of clogging my brain of any thoughts and errant things that were in there and it also helps me come up with interesting ideas for what I can do with my business and my life and even though there's a lot of apps and Tech on this list the trusty pen and paper notebook is just like one of the things that I go back to so often and really levels up my productivity as well all right next comes a quick five minute step in my morning routine where I use the app things 3 as my to-do list to figure out what I'm doing for the rest of the day now at the moment this is what my home screen on iOS looks like you can see that basically I've got a calendar at the top and then I've got two widgets for things so I've got the inbox widget 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=91)~~  and I've got the today widget and the way I think of managing a to-do list it's basically two different lists there is a to-do list and then a today list and I find that this generally keeps things simple so what I'll do is I'll look on my today list to see what shows up on there so for example film this video is on my today list call my grandma is on this list and this is something that repeats two days after completion which means if I take it off right now then it's going to show up two days from now and remind me that I should call my grandma this also synchronizes with my calendar so if we look at the top we can see what calendar events I've got on in my life and this is a nice way for me to plan my day in the morning it just takes a couple of minutes but it just helps me realize that okay this is exactly what I'm working on now generally I've got a pretty good idea of what I need to work on but in case I need some inspiration I look at my anytime list which is just like my endless to-do list and I decide okay what is the stuff on here that I 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=134)~~  just need to get done today I don't bother with this week I don't bother with this month because I find that all of that stuff is all a bit mythical all I do is focus on what are the things I need to do today now what happens next depends on whether I want to write something in the morning or whether I want to film something in the morning because that's generally how I use my mornings and generally if I want to write then I'll take my journal and I'll stick it in my bag along with my 11 inch iPad Pro and I'll head out of the house to a local coffee shop or a local restaurant and this is another productivity tool that served me well over the years and that is changing up the location I used to do this a lot in medical school I would go to different libraries and different coffee shops to work in those different locations in each day and generally I find that it makes work feel a lot more like play which is something I talk about in the first chapter of my upcoming book feel good productivity how to do more of what 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=173)~~  matters to you that's they'll be linked down below if you want to check it out and then another tool I find really useful is something like this this is the one that I use at the moment it's the peak design 6 liter sling and it's basically a fairly simple bag but it has enough space for an 11 inch iPad Pro and also my journal and pen and then if I feel like it I'll take a camera with me as well and that plops nicely into this bag and now I have a little slingback that I can carry around with me now having two different bags is actually super helpful so essentially my journal and my iPad always live in this one but then I also have my enormous laptop bag which is the Peter McKinnon everyday camera bag that has my laptop and a bunch of accessories and an extra camera in it as well but if I'm just leaving the house to go to a coffee shop to do some writing it's really nice to just be able to grab and go with the sling rather than have to Lug around the enormous laptop bag and this might be a bit Overkill but one of 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=216)~~  the things that I swear by is reducing the friction as much as possible for the things that I want to do more of in my life I would like to do more of going out and about and going to Local Coffee shop or going to the park and working from there until whatever I can do to reduce the friction of that happening makes it way easier for me to do and makes it way easier to build that habit at this point I'm at a local coffee shop or restaurant or wherever I like to change up the location and the app that I tend to mostly write on on my iPad is called Ulysses it's a very simple minimalistic markdown based writing app and so whether I'm writing my email newsletter or working on some new book projects or even planning videos usually I'll do the first draft of writing in Ulysses and then I'll transfer it into notion if it's a video or Google Docs if it's a book thing or convert email thing but Ulysses tends to be the place where I do most of my writing and the thing I like about it is that you can also track your daily word count and so I've set a 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=260)~~  target of a thousand words a day and I can see my progress towards that Target now one productivity tool that I haven't talked about in this video is in fact therapy which I have started recently in the last few months and has been game changing for me to help understand my own emotions understand the limiting beliefs that I've got getting in the way of my productivity and my life so I'm delighted to say that this video is a paid partnership with better help betterhelp is the world's largest therapy service and it's 100 online with better help you can tap into a network of over 30 000 credential therapists who can help you with whatever issues you find yourself struggling with to get started you just answer a handful of questions about yourself and about your needs and that way betterhelp can match you with the right therapist from the network and then when you've got your therapist you can talk to them in whatever way feels most comfortable for you it could be a phone call it could be a video call it could be by text and you 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=303)~~  can message your therapist anytime you can schedule live sessions whenever it's convenient for you and if for whatever reason you don't get on with your therapist you can always switch to another one if any of that stands up your street and you'd like to try out therapy with better help then and you can get 10 off by going to betterhelp.com that's better help help.com forward slash or you can hit the link in the video description and that will give you 10 off your first month so thank you so much better help for sponsoring this video and then once I'm done with a few hours of writing I'll usually come back home and get on my desk and then the thing that I'm playing when I'm on my desk is YouTube videos that have focused music so this is my YouTube homepage at the moment um you know the enchanted lands immersive writing session peaceful day at Hogwarts and I'll just put on a random one of these like Lord of the Rings Rivendell and be into music and this is just like the music that I like to have on in the background usually I full screen this 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=348)~~  and have it open on my second monitor because I don't really use the second monitor for much I'm mostly a single monitor kind of guy but it's nice having the ambience and having the sound and stuff in the background as a way of helping me focus when I'm working next I normally have a quick check of my emails to see if there's anything interesting that's popped up and the app that I've been using for my emails since 2019 is called superhuman and superhuman is the fastest tool I've ever seen to help navigate email and it's got loads of keyboard shortcuts which means I can get through my email inbox about twice as fast as I could with previous apps that have tried like the Gmail app and then usually while I'm there if there's no emails that require my attention I'll have a browse through any newsletters that I'm subscribed to and see if there's anything interesting so the two that I read most often are morning Brew which is a daily newsletter for like Tech and business and finance and secondly read wise which is an email 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=388)~~  that every morning it just sends me five highlights from books or articles of stuff that I've highlighted over the last like 10 years and so it's a great way of me resurfacing the things that I've highlighted in the past then for the rest of the workday we generally have even more writing and all my writing when it comes to videos and when it comes to courses is done in notion unsurprisingly again I've been using Notions since 2019 and we basically run our entire company using a notion and a few other bits of software so for example I'm writing this video in notion it's all planned out over here I've got my 25 or so bullet points and I'm I've got this open on the screen in front of me as I'm talking to you we've also got the content calendar with titles and thumbnails that are upcoming on the YouTube channel everything is organized in notion we've got annual objectives for our company we've got our key results so we use an okr system more on that later and then we've got the different quests or projects so the team 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=433)~~  are working on for the Sprint so we operate in five week cycles and so everyone has a little Quest or two that they're doing in the five weeks now while I'm doing this work stuff oftentimes I'll be on this desk which actually happens to be a standing desk but because all the cameras and stuff are connected to it I tend not to really use it in standing desk mode but and again this is kind of Overkill I also have an extra desk next to me which is also a standing desk that has a treadmill underneath it and the treadmill is genuinely one of the most useful things that I've installed in my productivity Arsenal over the last six months I think I installed it six months ago and in that time I've used the treadmill for 65 days I have traversed a different distance distance of 235 kilometers and I've used it 144 times on average twice a day for the 65 days and it's great you can see just over time if I sit down on the computer that's a Windows PC that's that's on the standing desk so if I'm playing Diablo 4 which is the game I'm playing these days I'll 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=478)~~  often be walking on the treadmill while I'm playing it but if I'm working I will just take my keyboard which is a mechanical keyboard which is the one that we're sort of building ourselves these days I'll take them accountable keyboard I'll move it from this Mac Mini over to the Windows PC I'll often switch between Windows and Mac just because it's kind of nice kind of nice to change platforms again a bit Overkill you don't need this but if you have a standing desk and you haven't yet tried a treadmill underneath it I would really recommend it I think the one I have is the walking pad C2 no relationship with them but I put an Amazon affiliate link down in the video description if you want to check it out speaking of keyboard I generally use a mechanical keyboard um this is one that we are in the process of building out for our Tech brand uh more on that in a little while so I've been testing a bunch of mechanical keyboards over the last like 12 months or so and when I'm switching between Windows and Mac there is a 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=521)~~  really good cross-platform app that I used to track my time and that is called rice now rice is a really good time tracking app that I've actually been using since November of 2021 so I've had it installed on my Mac and then on my Windows PC since that time you can see for all of 2022 I was tracking my time as well and then for all of 2023 so far I'm filming this in August I've also been tracking my time using rise it's an automatic time tracker so it basically figures out what app you're on what app is active or what like Chrome tab or Safari window is active for example I spent a lot of time in video conferencing I spent 183 hours on writing I've spent 87 hours documenting 76 hours as a meeting 183 hours spent in Google Docs this year that's quite a lot of time most of that was just doing edits in my book for example and I've Loved rice so much that I actually reached out to the guys who created ryze and I offered to invest in them and so we are now invested in rice as an angel investor which is kind of interesting 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=567)~~  but if you want to check it out then it'll be doing me a favor because then it'll show that my you know the amount I've invested in the company is like companies can grow fingers crossed um but that'll be linked down in the video description if you want to check it out so then usually when I've done a bunch of writing throughout the day in these various different apps that we've already talked about I then go on to filming a video so for example right now I'm filming a video and there's been a bunch of productivity tips and tricks and tools that I've used over the last six plus years to get the process of filming videos to be as efficient and low friction as possible because again it's a thing that I enjoy doing the thing I want to do and if I can just reduce the friction as much as possible to doing the thing it means I'm way more likely to do the thing and so on this desk for example everything is a bit of a mess right now but we've got this main angle that films camera angle a we've got camera angle B which is an overhead 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=608)~~  angle up here we've got camera angle C which is a shorts angle over there it's a third camera that I used to film short film content and all these cameras are hooked up with HDMI to the atem mini pro which is a camera switcher now this is really fun because if for example I'm doing a live session for my part-time YouTuber Academy which is my course I can switch between this camera angle and this overhead camera angle and then I can show my phone or I can do some writing or whatever the thing is and people's minds are absolutely blown when this is what a zoom call looks like then connect it up to the main camera we have the Sennheiser mk416 which is connected to a little kind of microphone stand up over there and this is nice because it means like this this microphone is just out of shot but hopefully the audio from this microphone is very good and then I also have this microphone which is the Elgato Wave 3 which is connected straight to my Mac and this is what I use if I'm on a podcast or sometimes if I'm doing videos 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=657)~~  or if I'm a zoom call for example this is the microphone that'll just sort of swing around and bring back in and this is connected to the Elgato microphone blow low low profile arm that we also use in our podcast setup now there's a few other tools that I have on my desk that are quite nice this thing I've got in front of me which is what the monitor is on this is a set from Ugg monk called The Gather 2.0 and it's like a stand for the Monitor and then a few other things it's got a phone charging dock thing over here which is quite nice and this little book that I put Post-it notes in because I enjoy Post-it notes and this other little box that I put Post-it notes in because I enjoy Post-it notes and it's like magnetized so it magnetizes to the to the laptop stand and this is nice because it frees up space on the desk which means the Mac Mini can go underneath the laptop stand which is kind of cool and then all of these gizmos the Mac Mini is connected to the cow digit TS3 Thunderbolt dock which is then what's the thing that 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=704)~~  powers these two displays and again there's going to be links to all of this stuff done in the video if you want to check it out and then after filming all the footage gets uploaded to Google Drive where we've used 75 terabytes out of the shared 115 terabytes that we have on Google Drive and we use Google workspace for all of our kind of teams email addresses and for this Google drive storage capacity as well now at various points in the day especially after having a coffee I might take a trip or two to the bathroom and when I'm on the toilet if I'm being unintentional with how I'm spending my time I'm scrolling Twitter or Instagram like most of us do but if I'm being intentional about how I'm spending my time then the app that I use which is amazing is called reader now reader is the very first app that I have on my iPhone on my screen number two and essentially it's an RSS feed aggregator that's built by the people who build readwise and so anytime I want to read an article it just gets saved into reader and then I 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=750)~~  can read those articles all in one go when I'm on the toilet so for example this is an article from Jack Reigns five career related things have recently changed my mind on and I can just read the whole article on reader and then if I want to highlight anything I can double click the thing it gets highlighted and then those highlights also synchronize with readwise which then also synchronize with notion which means I basically automatically save and resurface the stuff that I've read that I found interesting now usually after writing and filming which are the two big things that I need to do I will consult my calendar and the app that I use for my calendar is fantastic hell which again I've been using for absolutely years now so for example I've got a filming block right now and then at 11 30 we've got a Content meeting with content Squad and if nothing imminent is happening then usually once I've done the writing and filming thing I would just go for a walk and walking is another one of those absolutely underrated tools when it comes to 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=794)~~  productivity because it's really fun and it recharges energy and you can reconnect with the nature depending on where you're walking and I usually also find that some of the best ideas that I have are the ideas that I have while I'm walking now while I'm walking if I come across any ideas I will always have my phone with me and I'll just jot those ideas down in Apple notes and again I've tried dozens of different note-taking apps over the years but the one that I just default to if I need to write down something quickly is Apple notes and on my home screen on my iPhone I have my Apple notes inbox folder which is where stuff goes by default and then over time at some point when I feel like it I process what's in the Inbox and convert it into notion or into Ulysses documents or into tasks some things or whatever thing might be so for example the other day when I went for a walk I was listening to the audiobook the greatness mindset by my friend Louis hose and then as I was listening to that audiobook and coming across interesting things I was 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=837)~~  taking notes in Apple notes and then at some point I'm going to turn this into a video on the channel a book club episode about the book The Greatest mindset not usually when I'm walking I'm not listening to things but if I do feel like I want to listen to things then I'm either listening to a podcast on YouTube or Spotify or I'm listening to an audiobook on Audible and very excitingly my book is also going to be available on Audible I am narrating it in the in the penguin Studios next month so that's gonna be super fun I've got a whole three days where I'm spending all three days just narrating the audiobook and trying not to talk too fast and trying to bring the Vibes into reading my own book which should be fun but you can check it out on Audible I'll again I'll link the website down below for the book feel good productivity if you want to check it out you might like to pre-order because there's gonna be loads of bonuses if you pre-order all the details on the website there's another cool app that I found really helpful sometimes 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=877)~~  when I'm walking or when I'm driving and that is Otto that's auto.ai which is a sort of AI enabled um voice recording and transcription app and I've got the widget on page three of my phone and so if I ever need to just record something if I've got my airpods in or if I'm in a meeting or having a conversation where I feel like actually recording and transcribing this would be really helpful I just hit the record button on auto and then usually what that does is it starts recording immediately and I can just have my phone on in the background or whatever and it will do a almost perfect transcription of the meeting or whatever the conversation is and it will also use AI to summarize what's being said and what's been talked about and this is super helpful if I'm walking and I have an idea for a video but I don't want to sort of type it on my phone like this while I'm walking I'll just dictate it into Otto and then the rest of the day when it comes to productivity is broadly spent on General work stuff so we've talked about how we 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=921)~~  use notion for a lot of things we also use slack quite a lot for day-to-day communication and I've got a video up there that's a more detailed look of how I use 12 specific apps to run every aspect of my business we also use Loom which is a great screen recording software again amazing for saving time and not having meetings because if someone needs to update the team on anything they'll just record a loom and then we can just watch that Loom back at Double speed so for example this morning anger sent me this Loom kind of with an update on our business financials and I just watched this Loom at like 2.5 x speed and that saved loads of time and it meant that we didn't need Angus to have a meeting with me to update me as to what's going on with the finances of the business so it's really good for productivity in terms of saving time but also in terms of communication with the rest of the team now if it happens to be a workout day then at some point during the day I'll spend about an hour or so in the gym and the app that I use to

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=1014)~~  you can apply the principles of progressive overload because you can see what you did previously and then you can try and either increase the weight or increase the Reps in a very simple way of getting Progressive overload into your routine then there's just a random work stuff and then usually we'll get to the end of the day and usually at the end of the day I'll go out for a meal with friends or with business associates or something like that now either I'll walk if I want to get my steps in or I'll take an Uber or I'll take the train and I've sort of made it a bit of a rule for myself that whenever I'm in a cab or on public transport in any capacity I will just bust out my iPad and do some journaling and I do that in the app day one which again I've been using for absolutely years now I think I've been using day one since 2016 and so it's really nice because I can see seven years worth of journal entries into day one and so I just type you know that's where I Journal thoughts feelings ideas about the business ideas about my life

Затем я заварю себе чашку кофе, используя особый технологический предмет, называемый умной капельницей, который является очень хорошим способом приготовления фильтрованного кофе, а затем я использую один

Вы можете видеть, что в основном у меня есть календарь вверху, а затем у меня есть два виджета для вещей, поэтому у меня есть виджет входящих сообщений и у меня есть виджет «Сегодня», и то, как я думаю об управлении списком дел, это, по сути, два разных списка: список дел, а затем список на сегодня, и я считаю, что это в целом упрощает задачу, так что я  Я сделаю это, я посмотрю в своем списке на сегодня, чтобы увидеть, что там появляется, например, фильм, это видео в моем списке на сегодня, позвоню моей бабушке в этом списке, и это что-то повторяется через два дня после завершения, что означает, что если я  сними его прямо сейчас, и через два дня оно появится и напомнит мне, что мне следует позвонить бабушке. Это также синхронизируется с моим календарем, поэтому, если мы посмотрим вверху, мы увидим, какие события календаря у меня есть в моем  жизнь, и для меня это хороший способ спланировать свой день утром, это занимает всего пару 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=121)~~  минут, но это просто помогает мне осознать, что окей, это именно то, над чем я сейчас работаю, в общем, у меня есть довольно хорошая идея  над чем мне нужно поработать, но на случай, если мне понадобится вдохновение, я смотрю на свой список дел, который похож на мой бесконечный список дел, и решаю: « Хорошо, что здесь есть, что мне просто нужно сделать сегодня?»  меня не беспокоит эта неделя меня не волнует этот месяц, потому что я считаю, что все эти вещи немного мифичны, все, что я делаю, это сосредотачиваюсь на том, что мне нужно сделать сегодня, что произойдет дальше, зависит от того, буду ли я  хочу написать что-нибудь утром или хочу снять что-нибудь утром, потому что обычно именно так я провожу утро, и обычно, если я хочу написать, я беру свой дневник и кладу его в сумку вместе с  мой 11-дюймовый iPad Pro, и я отправляюсь из дома в местную кофейню или местный ресторан, и это еще один инструмент повышения производительности, который хорошо служил мне на протяжении многих лет и который меняет место, где я часто это делал  В

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=204)~~  лежит мой ноутбук, куча аксессуаров и дополнительная камера, но если я просто выхожу из дома, чтобы пойти в кафе, чтобы что-нибудь написать, очень приятно просто иметь возможность  хватай и иди с ремнем, вместо того, чтобы таскать за собой огромную сумку для ноутбука, и это может быть немного излишним, но одна из вещей, в которой я клянусь, — это максимальное уменьшение трения для тех вещей, которые я хочу делать больше  в своей жизни я хотел бы чаще гулять и ходить в местную кофейню или ходить в парк и работать оттуда до тех пор, пока все, что я могу сделать, чтобы уменьшить трение, происходящее в этом случае, не облегчит мне это и облегчает выработку этой привычки на данный момент. Я нахожусь в местной кофейне , ресторане или где-то еще, где мне нравится менять местоположение, и приложение, в котором я обычно пишу на своем iPad, называется Ulysses, это очень просто минималистичное приложение для письма на основе уценок, поэтому независимо от того, пишу ли я свой информационный бюллетень по электронной почте 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=243)~~  , работаю над какими-то новыми книжными проектами или даже планирую видео, обычно я делаю первый черновик письма в Ulysses, а затем перевожу его в концепцию, если это будет  видео или Google Docs, если это книга или конвертация электронной почты, но Ulysses, как правило, является местом, где я пишу большую часть своих писем, и что мне в нем нравится, так это то, что вы также можете отслеживать ежедневное количество слов, и поэтому я установил цель — тысяча слов в день, и я вижу свой прогресс в достижении этой цели. Ставьте сейчас один инструмент повышения производительности, о котором я не говорил в этом видео, на самом деле это терапия, которую я начал недавно, в последние несколько месяцев, и которая изменила правила игры.  для меня, чтобы помочь понять мои собственные эмоции, понять ограничивающие убеждения, которые у меня возникают на пути к моей продуктивности и моей жизни, поэтому я рад сообщить, что это видео представляет собой платное партнерство с лучшей помощью Betterhelp — крупнейшая в мире терапия  службы, и это 100 онлайн с

Обычно я быстро проверяю свою электронную почту, чтобы увидеть, есть ли что-нибудь интересное, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=361)~~  что всплывает  и приложение, которое я использую для своей электронной почты с 2019 года, называется «Сверхчеловеческое», и «Сверхчеловеческое» — это самый быстрый инструмент, который я когда-либо видел для навигации по электронной почте, и в нем есть множество сочетаний клавиш, что означает, что я могу просмотреть свой почтовый ящик примерно дважды.  так быстро, как я мог, с предыдущими приложениями, которые я пробовал, например, с приложением Gmail, а затем обычно, пока я там, если нет писем, требующих моего внимания, я просматриваю все информационные бюллетени, на которые я подписан, и смотрю, есть ли там  что-нибудь интересное, поэтому чаще всего я читаю утреннее пиво, которое представляет собой ежедневный информационный бюллетень по технологиям, бизнесу и финансам, и, во-вторых, читаю мудрое письмо, которое каждое утро просто отправляет мне пять основных моментов из книг или статей, которые я  Я выделил за последние около 10 лет, и это отличный способ вспомнить то, что я выделил в прошлом, а до конца рабочего дня у нас обычно 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=400)~~  еще больше сочинений, и все мои сочинения, когда дело доходит до видео.  и когда дело доходит до курсов, это неудивительно, что снова я использую Notions с 2019 года, и мы в основном управляем всей нашей компанией, используя понятие и несколько других частей программного обеспечения, поэтому, например, я пишу это видео в идее, и это все  запланировано здесь, у меня есть примерно 25 пунктов, и я открываю это на экране передо мной, пока я разговариваю с вами, у нас также есть календарь контента с заголовками и миниатюрами  которые появятся на канале YouTube, все организовано таким образом, что у нас есть годовые цели для нашей компании, у нас есть ключевые результаты, поэтому мы используем систему okr, подробнее об этом позже, а затем у нас есть различные квесты или проекты, так что  команда работает над спринтом, поэтому мы работаем пятинедельными циклами, и у каждого есть небольшой квест или два, которые они выполняют в течение пяти недель, а я часто занимаюсь этой работой, я часто сижу за этим столом на самом деле это рабочий стол, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=444)~~  но поскольку к нему подключены все камеры и прочее, я обычно не использую его в режиме стоя, но, опять же, это своего рода излишество. У меня также есть дополнительный стол рядом со мной, который тоже  стоячий стол, под которым находится беговая дорожка, и беговая дорожка действительно является одной из самых полезных вещей, которые я установил в свой арсенал производительности за последние шесть месяцев. Кажется, я установил его шесть месяцев назад и за это время я использовал беговая дорожка в течение 65 дней. Я преодолел различное расстояние в 235 километров и использовал ее в среднем 144 раза два раза в день в течение 65 дней, и это здорово, что вы можете увидеть это со временем, если я сажусь за компьютер, это ПК с Windows, который стоит на столе, поэтому, если я играю в Diablo 4, в которую я играю сейчас, я часто хожу по беговой дорожке, пока играю в нее, но если я работаю, я просто хожу по беговой дорожке.  возьми мою клавиатуру, механическую клавиатуру, которую мы сейчас как бы создаем сами. Я возьму им подотчетную 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=487)~~  клавиатуру. Я перенесу ее с этого Mac Mini на ПК с Windows. Я часто переключаюсь между Windows.  и Mac просто потому, что это вроде как приятно снова немного сменить платформу. Излишество, вам это не нужно, но если у вас есть стоячий стол, и вы еще не пробовали беговую дорожку под ним, я бы очень рекомендовал это, я думаю,  у меня есть прогулочная площадка C2, никакого отношения к ним нет, но я разместил партнерскую ссылку Amazon в описании видео, если вы хотите проверить ее, говоря о клавиатуре, я обычно использую механическую клавиатуру, хм, это та, над которой мы находимся в процессе  о создании нашего технологического бренда, подробнее об этом через некоторое время, поэтому я тестировал кучу механических клавиатур за последние около 12 месяцев или около того, и когда я переключаюсь между Windows и Mac, получается действительно хорошее сочетание  - приложение-платформа, которую я использовал для отслеживания своего времени, и которое называется « рис». Теперь рис — действительно хорошее приложение для отслеживания времени, которое я 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=527)~~  использую с ноября 2021 года, поэтому я установил его на свой Mac, а затем на свою Windows.  С тех пор вы можете видеть на ПК весь 2022 год. Я также отслеживал свое время, а затем весь 2023 год. Пока я снимаю это в августе. Я также отслеживаю свое время с помощью подъема, это автоматический счетчик времени, так что  в основном выясняет, в каком приложении вы находитесь, какое приложение активно или что, например, вкладка Chrome или окно Safari активно, например, я провел много времени в видеоконференциях, я потратил 183 часа на написание, я потратил 87 часов на документирование, 76 часов как  встреча 183 часа, проведенные в Google Docs в этом году, это довольно много времени, большую часть времени я просто редактировал, например, мою книгу, и мне так понравился рис, что я даже обратился к ребятам, которые создали ryze, и предложил  инвестировать в них, и поэтому мы теперь инвестируем в рис как инвестор-ангел, что довольно интересно, но если вы захотите проверить это, то это окажет мне услугу, потому что тогда 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=570)~~  это покажет, что вы знаете сумму Я инвестировал в компанию, это похоже на то, что компании могут скрестить пальцы, но это будет указано в описании видео, если вы захотите это проверить, так обычно бывает, когда я в течение дня много писал в этих различные приложения, о которых мы уже говорили, затем я приступаю к съемке видео, например, прямо сейчас я снимаю видео, и есть множество советов, приемов и инструментов по повышению производительности, которые я использовал за последние шесть лет.  плюс годы, чтобы сделать процесс съемки видео максимально эффективным и с минимальным трением, потому что, опять же, мне нравится делать то, что я хочу делать, и если я могу просто максимально уменьшить трение, делая то, что делаю, это  означает, что у меня гораздо больше шансов сделать это, и, например, на этом столе сейчас все в некотором беспорядке, но у нас есть основной ракурс, который снимает угол камеры a, у нас есть угол камеры B, который является угол сверху, здесь у нас есть угол камеры C, который является коротким углом, вот это 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=612)~~  третья камера, которую я использовал для съемки короткометражных фильмов, и все эти камеры подключены через HDMI к atem mini pro, который теперь является переключателем камер.  это действительно весело, потому что, если, например, я провожу прямую трансляцию для своей Академии YouTuber, работающей неполный рабочий день, что является моим курсом, я могу переключаться между этим ракурсом камеры и этим ракурсом камеры над головой, а затем я могу показать свой телефон или сделать что-нибудь пишет или что-то в этом роде, и люди просто взорвались, когда так выглядит вызов с зумом, затем подключите его к основной камере, у нас есть Sennheiser mk416, который подключен к небольшому микрофону, встаньте там, и это  приятно, потому что это означает, что этот микрофон просто не в кадре, но, надеюсь, звук с этого микрофона очень хороший, а еще у меня есть микрофон Elgato Wave 3, который подключен прямо к моему Mac, и это то, что я использую, если  Я на подкасте или иногда, если я снимаю видео, или если я звоню по зуму, например, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=659)~~  это микрофон, который просто как бы поворачивается и возвращается, и он подключен к микрофону Elgato, дующему низко  низкопрофильный кронштейн, который мы также используем при настройке наших подкастов, теперь у меня на столе есть еще несколько довольно хороших инструментов, эта штука передо мной, на которой стоит монитор, это набор от Ugg  монах назвал The Gather 2.0, и это что-то вроде подставки для монитора, а также еще несколько вещей, здесь есть док-станция для зарядки телефона, что очень приятно, и эта маленькая книжка, в которую я кладу заметки Post-it, потому что мне нравятся Post-it  заметки и еще одна маленькая коробочка, в которую я кладу стикеры Post-it, потому что мне нравятся стикеры Post-it, и они как бы намагничены, поэтому притягиваются к подставке для ноутбука, и это приятно, потому что это освобождает место на столе, а это значит, что Mac Mini можно положить под подставку для ноутбука, что довольно круто, а затем все эти штуковины Mac Mini подключаются к док-станции Thunderbolt TS3 с цифрой коровы, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=702)~~  которая и является тем, что питает эти два дисплея, и снова будут ссылки на все  все это сделано в видео, если вы хотите это проверить, а затем после съемки все отснятый материал загружается на Google Диск, где мы использовали 75 терабайт из общих 115 терабайт, которые у нас есть на Google Диске, и мы используем рабочую область Google.  для адресов электронной почты всех наших команд, а также для этого объема памяти на диске Google, а также теперь в разное время дня, особенно после кофе, я мог бы сходить или два в ванную, и когда я в туалете, если я  Я непреднамеренно провожу свое время. Я пролистываю Твиттер или Инстаграм, как это делает большинство из нас, но если я намеренно провожу свое время, то приложение, которое я использую, и которое является потрясающим, называется  Reader Now Reader&nbsp;— самое первое приложение, которое установлено на моем iPhone на втором экране, и, по сути, это агрегатор RSS-каналов, созданный людьми, которые создают Readwise, и поэтому каждый раз, когда я хочу прочитать статью, она 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=748)~~  просто сохраняется в Reader и  тогда я могу прочитать эти статьи все за один раз, когда я в туалете, например, это статья Джека Рейнса о пяти вещах, связанных с карьерой, о которых я недавно передумал, и я могу просто прочитать всю статью на Reader, а затем, если Я хочу выделить все, что я могу дважды щелкнуть по объекту, который выделен, а затем эти выделения также синхронизируются с readwise, который затем также синхронизируется с понятием, что означает, что я в основном автоматически сохраняю и повторно отображаю то, что я прочитал, и что я нашел интересным сейчас, обычно после писать и снимать видео, а это две важные вещи, которые мне нужно сделать. Я сверюсь со своим календарем, и приложение, которое я использую для своего календаря, - это чертовски чертовски круто, которым я снова пользуюсь уже много лет, так что, например, у меня есть  съемочный блок прямо сейчас, а затем в 11:30 у нас встреча по контенту с командой по контенту, и если ничего не происходит в ближайшее время, то обычно, как только я закончу писать и снимать, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=790)~~  я просто иду гулять, и прогулка - еще один из  эти абсолютно недооцененные инструменты, когда дело доходит до продуктивности, потому что это действительно весело и заряжает энергией, и вы можете воссоединиться с природой в зависимости от того, куда вы идете, и я обычно также нахожу, что некоторые из лучших идей, которые у меня есть, - это идеи, которые я  есть, пока иду сейчас, пока иду, если у меня возникнут какие-либо идеи, у меня всегда будет с собой телефон, и я просто записываю эти идеи в заметки Apple, и снова я попробовал десятки разных способов ведения заметок приложений на протяжении многих лет, но если мне нужно что-то быстро записать, я просто использую заметки Apple, а на главном экране iPhone у меня есть папка «Входящие» заметок Apple, куда все помещается по умолчанию, а затем с течением времени в  в какой-то момент, когда мне хочется, я обрабатываю то, что находится в папке «Входящие», и преобразую это в идею, или в документы Улисса, или в задачи, некоторые вещи или что-то еще, может быть так, например, на 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=830)~~  днях, когда я пошел на прогулку, я слушал аудиокнигу мышление величия моего друга Луи Хоуза, а затем, когда я слушал эту аудиокнигу и натыкался на интересные вещи, я делал заметки в Apple Notes, а затем в какой-то момент я собираюсь превратить это в видео на канале книжного клуба  эпизод о книге «Величайшее мышление» Обычно, когда я иду, я ничего не слушаю, но если я чувствую, что хочу что-то послушать, тогда я либо слушаю подкаст на YouTube или Spotify, либо я  слушаю аудиокнигу на Audible, и, что очень интересно, моя книга также будет доступна на Audible. Я буду рассказывать ее в Penguin Studios в следующем месяце, так что это будет очень весело. У меня есть целых три дня, которые я провожу.  все три дня я просто озвучивал аудиокнигу, старался не говорить слишком быстро и пытался привнести атмосферу в чтение моей собственной книги, что должно быть весело, но вы можете проверить ее на Audible. Я еще раз дам ссылку на веб-сайт ниже, чтобы  книга кажется хорошей продуктивностью, если вы хотите ее проверить, возможно, вы захотите оформить предварительный заказ, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=873)~~  потому что если вы предварительно закажете все детали на веб-сайте, вас ждет множество бонусов. Есть еще одно классное приложение, которое иногда оказывается очень полезным, когда я  Я иду или когда я за рулем, и это Отто, это auto.ai, что-то вроде приложения для записи и транскрипции голоса с поддержкой искусственного интеллекта, и у меня есть виджет на третьей странице моего телефона, так что, если мне когда-нибудь понадобится, просто  запишите что-нибудь, если у меня есть Airpods, или если я нахожусь на встрече или разговариваю, и мне хочется на самом деле записать и расшифровать, это было бы очень полезно, я просто нажимаю кнопку записи в автоматическом режиме, а затем обычно это происходит он сразу же начинает запись, и я могу просто включить телефон в фоновом режиме или что-то в этом роде, и он сделает почти идеальную расшифровку встречи или любого другого разговора, а также будет использовать ИИ для обобщения того, что было сказано и о чем говорили, и  это очень полезно, если я иду и у меня есть идея для видео, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXYjFsuVOoc&t=911)~~  но я не хочу вот так набирать ее на телефоне во время прогулки, я просто продиктую ее Отто, а затем все остальное  день, когда дело доходит до производительности, в основном тратится на общие рабочие дела, поэтому мы поговорили о том, как мы используем понятие для многих вещей, мы также довольно часто используем Slack для повседневного общения, и у меня есть там более подробно показано, как я использую 12 конкретных приложений для ведения каждого аспекта своего бизнеса. Мы также используем Loom, отличное программное обеспечение для записи экрана, которое снова отлично подходит для экономии времени и отсутствия встреч, потому что, если кому-то нужно обновить команду  на чем угодно они просто записывают ткацкий станок, а затем мы можем просто посмотреть этот ткацкий станок обратно на двойной скорости, так что, например, сегодня утром гнев прислал мне этот ткацкий станок вроде как с обновленной информацией о финансовых показателях нашего бизнеса, и я только что посмотрел этот ткацкий станок примерно в 2,5 раза.
