Obsidian Latex Suite
====================


A plugin for Obsidian that aims to make typesetting LaTeX math as fast as handwriting.


Inspired by [Gilles Castel's setup using UltiSnips](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/).


[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/main/gifs/demo.gif)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/main/gifs/demo.gif)


The plugin's main feature is **snippets**, which help you write LaTeX quicker through shortcuts and text expansion! For example, type


* "sqx" instead of "\sqrt{x}"
* "a/b" instead of "\frac{a}{b}"
* "par x y " instead of "\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}"


See [Gilles Castel's writeup](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) for more information.


The plugin comes with a [set of default snippets](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/blob/main/src/default_snippets.js), loosely based on [Gilles Castel's](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/#other-snippets). You can modify them, remove them, and write your own.


Usage
-----


To get started, type "dm" to enter display math mode. Try typing the following:


* "xsr" → "x^{2}".
* "x/y `Tab`" → "\frac{x}{y}".
* "sin @t" → "\sin \theta".


**Have a look at the [cheatsheet](#cheatsheet)** for a list of commonly used default snippets.


Once these feel familiar, you can check out the [default snippets](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/blob/main/src/default_snippets.js) for more commands. e.g.


* "par `Tab` f `Tab` x `Tab`" → "\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}".
* "dint `Tab` 2pi `Tab` sin @t `Tab` @t `Tab`" → "\int\_{0}^{2\pi} \sin \theta \, d\theta".


You can also add your own snippets! [See here for more info on writing snippets](#snippets). You can [view snippets written by others and share your own snippets here](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/discussions/50).


Features
--------


### Auto-fraction


Lets you type "1/x" instead of "\frac{1}{x}".


For example, it makes the following expansions:


* `x/` → `\frac{x}{}`
* `(a + b(c + d))/` → `\frac{a + b(c + d)}{}`


and moves the cursor inside the brackets.


Once done typing the denominator, press `Tab` to exit the fraction.

### Matrix shortcuts


While inside a matrix, array, align, or cases environment,


* Pressing `Tab` will insert the "&" symbol
* Pressing `Enter` will insert "\\" and move to a new line
* Pressing `Shift + Enter` will move to the end of the next line (can be used to exit the matrix)

### Conceal


*This feature must be enabled in settings!*


Make your equations more readable by hiding LaTeX code, instead rendering it in a pretty format.


For example, "\dot{x}^{2} + \dot{y}^{2}" will be displayed as "ẋ² + ẏ²".


To reveal the LaTeX code, move the cursor over it.

### Tabout


* Pressing `Tab` while the cursor is at the end of an equation will move the cursor outside the $ symbols.
* Otherwise, pressing `Tab` will advance the cursor to the next closing bracket: ), ], }, >, or |.


### Preview inline math


When the cursor is inside inline math, a popup window showing the rendered math will be displayed.

### Color & highlight matching brackets


* Matching brackets are rendered in the same color, to help with readability.
* When the cursor is adjacent to a bracket, that bracket and its pair will be highlighted.
* When the cursor is inside brackets, the enclosing brackets will be highlighted.

### Visual snippets


Sometimes you want to annotate math, or cancel or cross out terms. Selecting some math with the cursor and typing


* "U" will surround it with "\underbrace".
* "O" will surround it with "\overbrace".
* "C" will surround it with "\cancel".
* "K" will surround it with "\cancelto".
* "B" will surround it with "\underset".


[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/main/gifs/visual_snippets.gif)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/main/gifs/visual_snippets.gif)


### Auto-enlarge brackets


When a snippet containing "\sum", "\int" or "\frac" is triggered, any enclosing brackets will be enlarged with "\left" and "\right".

### Editor commands


* Box current equation – surround the equation the cursor is currently in with a box.
* Select current equation – select the equation the cursor is currently in.


### Snippets


Snippets are formatted as follows:



```
{
  trigger: string | RegExp,
  replacement: string,
  options: string,
  priority?: number,
  description?: string,
  flags?: string,
}
```

* `trigger` : The text that triggers this snippet.
	+ Triggers can also be regular expressions. [See here for more info.](/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/blob/main/DOCS.md#regex-snippets)
* `replacement` : The text to replace the `trigger` with.
	+ Replacements can also be JavaScript functions. [See here for more info.](/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/blob/main/DOCS.md#function-snippets)
* `options` : See below.
* `priority` (optional): This snippet's priority. Snippets with higher priority are run first. Can be negative. Defaults to 0.
* `description` (optional): A description for this snippet.
* `flags` (optional): Flags for regex snippets.


#### Options


* `t` : Text mode. Only run this snippet outside math
* `m` : Math mode. Only run this snippet inside math. Shorthand for both `M` and `n`
* `M` : Block math mode. Only run this snippet inside a `$$ ... $$` block
* `n` : Inline math mode. Only run this snippet inside a `$ ... $` block
* `A` : Auto. Expand this snippet as soon as the trigger is typed. If omitted, the `Tab` key must be pressed to expand the snippet
* `r` : [Regex](/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/blob/main/DOCS.md#regex-snippets). The `trigger` will be treated as a regular expression
* `v` : [Visual](/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/blob/main/DOCS.md#visual-snippets). Only run this snippet on a selection. The trigger should be a single character
* `w` : Word boundary. Only run this snippet when the trigger is preceded (and followed by) a word delimiter, such as `.`, `,`, or `-`.
* `c` : Code mode. Only run this snippet inside a ```` ... ```` block


Insert **tabstops** for the cursor to jump to by writing "$0", "$1", etc. in the `replacement`.


For more details on writing snippets, including **regex** snippets and **function** snippets, [see the **documentation** here](/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/blob/main/DOCS.md). You can [view snippets written by others and share your own snippets here](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/discussions/50).


Warning

Snippet files are interpreted as JavaScript and can execute arbitrary code.
Always be careful with snippets shared from others to avoid running malicious code.
