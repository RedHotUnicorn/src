🦙🌲🤏 Alpaca-LoRA
===============


* 🤗 **Try the pretrained model out [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tloen/alpaca-lora), courtesy of a GPU grant from Huggingface!**
* Users have created a Discord server for discussion and support [here](https://discord.gg/prbq284xX5)
* 4/14: Chansung Park's GPT4-Alpaca adapters: [#340](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/340)


This repository contains code for reproducing the [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) results using [low-rank adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf).
We provide an Instruct model of similar quality to `text-davinci-003` that can run [on a Raspberry Pi](https://twitter.com/miolini/status/1634982361757790209) (for research),
and the code is easily extended to the `13b`, `30b`, and `65b` models.


In addition to the training code, which runs within hours on a single RTX 4090,
we publish a script for downloading and inference on the foundation model and LoRA,
as well as the resulting [LoRA weights themselves](https://huggingface.co/tloen/alpaca-lora-7b/tree/main).
To fine-tune cheaply and efficiently, we use Hugging Face's [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft)
as well as Tim Dettmers' [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes).


Without hyperparameter tuning, the LoRA model produces outputs comparable to the Stanford Alpaca model. (Please see the outputs included below.) Further tuning might be able to achieve better performance; I invite interested users to give it a try and report their results.


### Local Setup


1. Install dependencies



```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. If bitsandbytes doesn't work, [install it from source.](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/compile_from_source.md) Windows users can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/17).


### Training (`finetune.py`)


This file contains a straightforward application of PEFT to the LLaMA model,
as well as some code related to prompt construction and tokenization.
PRs adapting this code to support larger models are always welcome.


Example usage:



```
python finetune.py \
    --base_model 'decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf' \
    --data_path 'yahma/alpaca-cleaned' \
    --output_dir './lora-alpaca'
```

We can also tweak our hyperparameters:



```
python finetune.py \
    --base_model 'decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf' \
    --data_path 'yahma/alpaca-cleaned' \
    --output_dir './lora-alpaca' \
    --batch_size 128 \
    --micro_batch_size 4 \
    --num_epochs 3 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4 \
    --cutoff_len 512 \
    --val_set_size 2000 \
    --lora_r 8 \
    --lora_alpha 16 \
    --lora_dropout 0.05 \
    --lora_target_modules '[q_proj,v_proj]' \
    --train_on_inputs \
    --group_by_length
```

### Inference (`generate.py`)


This file reads the foundation model from the Hugging Face model hub and the LoRA weights from `tloen/alpaca-lora-7b`, and runs a Gradio interface for inference on a specified input. Users should treat this as example code for the use of the model, and modify it as needed.


Example usage:



```
python generate.py \
    --load_8bit \
    --base_model 'decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf' \
    --lora_weights 'tloen/alpaca-lora-7b'
```

### Official weights


The most recent "official" Alpaca-LoRA adapter available at [`tloen/alpaca-lora-7b`](https://huggingface.co/tloen/alpaca-lora-7b) was trained on March 26 with the following command:



```
python finetune.py \
    --base_model='decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf' \
    --num_epochs=10 \
    --cutoff_len=512 \
    --group_by_length \
    --output_dir='./lora-alpaca' \
    --lora_target_modules='[q_proj,k_proj,v_proj,o_proj]' \
    --lora_r=16 \
    --micro_batch_size=8
```

### Checkpoint export (`export_*_checkpoint.py`)


These files contain scripts that merge the LoRA weights back into the base model
for export to Hugging Face format and to PyTorch `state_dicts`.
They should help users
who want to run inference in projects like [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
or [alpaca.cpp](https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp).


### Docker Setup & Inference


1. Build the container image:



```
docker build -t alpaca-lora .
```

1. Run the container (you can also use `finetune.py` and all of its parameters as shown above for training):



```
docker run --gpus=all --shm-size 64g -p 7860:7860 -v ${HOME}/.cache:/root/.cache --rm alpaca-lora generate.py \
    --load_8bit \
    --base_model 'decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf' \
    --lora_weights 'tloen/alpaca-lora-7b'
```

1. Open `https://localhost:7860` in the browser


### Docker Compose Setup & Inference


1. (optional) Change desired model and weights under `environment` in the `docker-compose.yml`
2. Build and run the container



```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

1. Open `https://localhost:7860` in the browser
2. See logs:



```
docker-compose logs -f
```

1. Clean everything up:



```
docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all
```

### Notes


* We can likely improve our model performance significantly if we had a better dataset. Consider supporting the [LAION Open Assistant](https://open-assistant.io/) effort to produce a high-quality dataset for supervised fine-tuning (or bugging them to release their data).
* We're continually fixing bugs and conducting training runs, and the weights on the Hugging Face Hub are being updated accordingly. In particular, those facing issues with response lengths should make sure that they have the latest version of the weights and code.
* Users with multiple GPUs should take a look [here](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/8#issuecomment-1477490259).
* We include the Stanford Alpaca dataset, which was made available under the ODC Attribution License.
