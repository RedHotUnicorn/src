 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=0)~~  hey friends welcome back to the channel as you guys know I'm absolutely obsessed with trying to save time in any ways that I can because time is really our most valuable non-renewable resource we can always make more money but we can never make more time and so in this video I want to talk through seven habits that I try my best to do every day and that saved me around three hours every single day coming in at number seven we have a habit that saves me around 10 minutes a day and that is the capture habit now this is a strategy from David Allen's book getting things done which is the Bible of productivity that first came out in 2003 and the idea is that anytime you have a thought or you remember something that you need to do instead of doing it there and then you make it a point to immediately capture it and offload it to some other sort of system so that your brain is not having to think about it so for example if I'm in the middle of doing some work and I think oh I need to call my grandma then what I'll do is that I'll either 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=45)~~  write it down on a piece of paper directly in front of me so I know I've got it captured or more likely I'd put it straight into the app things which I use on my Mac it saves a lot of time and it also saves a lot of headspace because a you're not distracting yourself trying to go somewhere else and write down the thing you're also not wasting time trying to remember what you think you've forgotten the only problem is I can't remember what I've forgotten and then when you have moments of spare time you can just look at your to-do list and think oh cool these are the things I've already captured and these are the things that I want to do and you can use any kind of app for this you can use pen and paper you can use Post-it nodes you can use things to do it notion whatever you want whatever app works for you Apple reminders Apple notes whatever the thing might be it really doesn't matter as long as you have a centralized place where you can capture your thoughts and capture your ideas and then not have to worry too much about it and waste time 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=86)~~  having to think about it alright coming in at number six we have a habit that saves me around 15 minutes every day and that is what I call the daily adventure and this habit is basically where every single morning I ask myself when I sit down to work what is today's adventure going to be now this habit serves two purposes the main purpose that saves time is that it encourages me to think about what is my most important task for the day in the book make time for example where I first got this many years ago when I read the book they call it the daily highlight where you just ask yourself what's the most important thing I need to do today and even if that's the only one thing that you do for the day as long as you're doing this for 365 days you're really winning and you're saving tons and tons of time and effort and also moving towards your goals over the course of a year the second main benefit of this is that ideally the most important thing that you would do would be the first thing that you do that day when you have a 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=127)~~  little bit of spare time so it removes that kind of cognitive burden of having to think about what was that thing I need to do again and the third benefit and the reason why I call it a daily Adventure these days rather than a daily highlight is because thinking about it as an adventure just makes it seem a little bit more fun the single biggest productivity hack of all time is finding a way to enjoy what you're doing and finding a way to generate energy from that thing that you're doing so let's say I've got this I don't know PowerPoint presentation that I need to finish that's like super important I could think of it as my most important task or I can think of it as today's adventure maybe I'd have Harry Potter music in the background while I'm doing the thing to make it feel more fun [Music] maybe I'd go out to a coffee shop or maybe I'd sit on a park bench nearby if it's sunny outside like there are different things that I can do to approach this activity that I have to do with a little bit more enjoyment a little bit more energy A little bit more 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=173)~~  like an adventure all right coming in at number five we have another habit that saves me around 15 minutes a day and that's what I call the Rainbow calendar and basically the idea behind the rainbow calendar is that ideally every morning I want to be planning out my calendar for the rest of the day and I like to color code things so it feels as if it's a rainbow that doesn't have too many gaps in it because the problem with gaps in the calendar is that at least for me I find that the sort of person I am when I have a gap in my calendar and I don't know what I intend to do in that time I inevitably spend that time doing something non-intentional like randomly scrolling Instagram or Tick Tock and generally it's not me living my best life when I'm randomly scrolling Instagram and Tick Tock for the record I have nothing against using social media I'm a professional social media user myself but what I want for myself is that the time I'm spending on YouTube or social media or whatever is time that I intend to be spending on YouTube or 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=218)~~  social media or whatever not time that I've accidentally found myself spending on it because I just didn't have a default activity that I wanted to do in that time instead so for example in my calendar I literally have a Blog every day for breakfast a block for work a block for lunch a block for a little break sometimes a Blog for going to the walk to get coffee sometimes I have a block where I'm like okay I'll just do whatever in that block but then I'm intending that that block is just for me to do whatever I've actually tried this I've run this experiment a few times where I've not time blocked stuff in the daytime and I found that inevitably every sort of it's approached like 12 o'clock and I'm like oh you know I don't have anything to do right now and then I'll just end up scrolling Instagram the more this becomes a habit and the more you follow your own intentions at least for me I find that it saves me quite a lot of time I eat around 15 minutes a day all right coming in at number four is a habit that saves me around 20 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=259)~~  minutes each day and that is what I call the five minute Rule now the five minute rule has two components the first one is that if I'm struggling to do something I can just get started for five minutes so for example filming this video I was procrastinating a little bit from filming this video but then I thought you know what five minute rule I'm just gonna film the video for five minutes and then I can stop if I want to but that's how we beat procrastination because the hardest part is getting started it's like when you're like pushing a trolley in the supermarket it's a bit of a push to get started but once the trolley is moving it just kind of Carries On Moving and now I don't know we're 12 minutes into filming this video or however long it's been I'm enjoying it now it's not a thing that I need to procrastinate from but the second aspect of the five minute rule is that five minutes is way better than nothing now especially when you organize your life with your calendar like it's it's very easy to let like on the hour 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=300)~~  be the only legit time that you can start something like oh it's 11 48 right now I couldn't possibly do anything for 12 minutes until 12 so I'm just gonna wait until 12 and then I'll do my next thing when I'm thinking in that kind of mindset I'm wasting a lot of time doing things unintentionally in those 12 minutes whereas I find with a five minute rule I tell myself oh it's 12 48 okay that's two lots of five minutes I could spend 10 minutes working on something interesting that could be checking through my emails it could be replying to some friends on WhatsApp it could be making a little bit of progress on my book it could even be drafting a video like there was a five minute blog this morning where I drafted a whole new video that I'm gonna do next and people often ask me you know how did you manage to make videos while you were working full-time all that stuff for the first three years of this YouTube channel and really a big chunk of it was the five minute rule when I would have five minutes in between seeing patients 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=343)~~  waiting for some blood test results to arrive waiting for the tea to brew if I'm making tea for the nurses I would generally get out a piece of paper and then start like drafting out a video in that time and so using the five minute rule in This Way saves me around I'd say 20 minutes maybe even more time every single day just a quick break from the video to tell you about our sponsor which is very excitingly heal now I've been a pain customer of huel since way back in 2017. I started eating healed in my fifth year of medical school because I was finding that with like going to placements and trying to study for exams and building the YouTube channel and running my business there were lots of times where I just didn't really have time to have a proper meal and so since I started heal instead of defaulting to some kind of unhealthy takeout I would often find myself thinking you know what let me just take some heal and blend the powder up with some water with some milk and it would be a fantastic replacement for breakfast or for lunch these days my 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=386)~~  favorite product from heel is the Black Edition and the reason I love the Black Edition is a because it tastes really nice they've got a salted caramel flavor which is sick and also because it's got an incredible 40 grams of protein for a 400 calorie serving and so with my latest health goals I've been working with a fitness coach to try and get hinge it's super handy to be able to eat heal as a breakfast option and it's healthy it's vegan it's got a bunch of really good micronutrients in it as well also heal is very reasonably priced like a meal with 400 calories comes out to about one pound 68 per meal which is super cheap compared to what the alternative would be if you're like me and ordering takeout instead for example anyway if you like the idea of getting these cheap and healthy and nutritionally complete meals in your diet then click the link in the video description and then you can order your first delivery of huel and alongside that they will send you a free heel t-shirt which are generally quite good 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=428)~~  and also a free Shaker type bottle thingy so that if you don't have a blender you don't need a blender you get free stuff along with your delivery of heal so thank you so much heel for sponsoring this video all right coming in at number three we have a habit or a system rather that saves me at least 30 minutes every day and that's what I call the focus phone now phones are an absolutely incredible device incredible invention but they're an absolute time sink when it comes to distracting us from the things that we actually want to do most of us do not intentionally spend a lot of time on our phone we find ourselves spending time on our phone so there are three things in particular that I do to help me focus more and waste less time on my phone the first one is that my phone is almost always on some kind of focus mode now this happens automatically because I actually time block everything in my calendar and so right now my phone is in work mode which means I'm not going to see any notifications except my girlfriend my 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=473)~~  mum my brother and my sister-in-law those are the only four people whose notifications come through while my phone is in any kind of focus mode and that means that when I want to open WhatsApp group chats I'm doing it intentionally on my own time rather than on someone else's time secondly what I do is I always keep my phone face down there is something about having a phone face up in front of you that is just like a recipe for disaster and a recipe for distraction and there's something about the phone being face down that makes it seem a lot less threatening and a lot less inviting as a device and the third strategy that I found helpful is that when I have periods where I'm spending too much time on social media I install a quick app called one sec but essentially what one sec does is that anytime you open Instagram or Tick Tock or YouTube and you and you can decide what apps it is it like opens up with this thing and it makes you take a breath and then breathe out again and then it says hey would you like to go on 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=515)~~  Kindle or audible in that time instead because you can set what kind of more intentional apps you want in that time and usually by the time I've taken a few seconds to take a breath and breathe out again and ask myself do I really want to be going on Instagram right now the answer is hell no and then I close Instagram now I like this app so much that I reached out to the guy who made it on Twitter and he's very kindly created like a free trial link just for a slot so that'll be linked down below if you want to check it out all right coming in at habit number two is another habit that saves me at least 30 minutes every day sometimes 60 Minutes sometimes longer than that and that is the alarm clock and basically the idea here is using a physical alarm clock as my bedtime alarm clock rather than my phone now I've been on and off with this habit for the last several years but I find that whenever I don't use a physical alarm clock and I think oh it's fine my phone is my alarm it's way easier than a physical alarm clock and I have my phone 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=559)~~  charging on my bedside inevitably I waste at least half an hour sometimes an hour sometimes even two or three hours before I sleep and then even when I wake up in the morning it's too easy a to snooze the alarm B to cancel the alarm and see to then just lie in bed and just go on my phone for a bit especially if I don't have anything that morning and now we have habit number one which saves me at least 60 Minutes every day sometimes more and that is a simple rule that I am not allowed to watch TV unless it's with friends this is a very controversial thing I know some people are like like feel borderline religious about oh my God I need to have my two hours of watching Netflix every night because if I don't then it's really bad for my health and all this I call BS to most of that kind of stuff I used to watch so much TV when I was younger I used to watch quite a lot of TV at University and then one day I realized hang on I'm wasting like so much time watching TV I think the average American watches somewhere between one and four hours 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=604)~~  every day of TV for me it was about an hour a day on average and I realized that you know when I was on my deathbed I probably wouldn't regret not having watched more TV and so I tried this I tried making this rule for myself when I was at University no TV unless it's with friends so when Game of Thrones would come out we'd do a Sig Game of Thrones nights we'll invite people over it would be super fun and that would turn into a social experience but it meant that I wasn't spending every evening after lectures catching up on Gray's Anatomy or The Vampire Diaries or the office or watching reruns of friends or whatever and that freed up so much time in my life at University to build my business to build my YouTube channel I almost never watched TV when I was working as a doctor as well I would do YouTube stuff in the evenings and all of that was way more fulfilling and way more intentional than sitting down and trying to watch TV for example now I'm know this is controversial I know some people want to cancel me for promoting toxic 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=645)~~  productivity and hustle clutch and all that kind of stuff all I'm saying is try cutting out TV from your life for like a month and see if you miss it and if you really miss it if you really can't live without it if it's really you living your best life by watching more TV on your own sitting on your computer and watching Netflix by all means you're living your best life and you're living intentionally but if in my case I realized hang on I'm actually not proud of that time I spent watching TV I'd rather go for a walk in nature rather go for a run rather go to the gym so overall these seven habits save me at least three hours every single day I hope you found at least some of them helpful and you might try and incorporate them into your life and if you're interested in more tips related to productivity you might like to check out this video over here which is 12 cheap purchases I.E under about 20 that have genuinely been able to boost my productivity so that's a video over there thank you so much for watching and

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=0)~~  эй, друзья, добро пожаловать обратно на канал, так как вы, ребята, знаете, я абсолютно одержим попытками сэкономить время любыми возможными способами, потому что время действительно наш самый ценный невозобновляемый ресурс, мы всегда можем заработать больше денег, но мы никогда не сможем заработать больше  время, и поэтому в этом видео я хочу рассказать о семи привычках, которые я изо всех сил стараюсь выполнять каждый день, и которые экономят мне около трех часов каждый день, идя под номером семь, у нас есть привычка, которая экономит мне около 10 минут в день, и  это привычка улавливать, это стратегия из книги Дэвида Аллена «Достижение цели», которая представляет собой Библию продуктивности, впервые вышедшую в 2003 году, и идея в том, что каждый раз, когда у вас появляется мысль или вы вспоминаете что-то, что вам нужно сделать, вместо того, чтобы  делая это тут же, вы ставите перед собой цель немедленно захватить это и перегрузить в какую-то другую систему, чтобы вашему мозгу не приходилось об этом думать, например, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=40)~~  если я делаю какую-то работу, и я  подумай, о, мне нужно позвонить бабушке, тогда я либо запишу это на листе бумаги прямо перед собой, чтобы я знал, что запечатлел это, либо, что более вероятно, я бы положил это  прямо в приложении, которое я использую на своем Mac, это экономит много времени, а также экономит много свободного пространства, потому что вы не отвлекаетесь, пытаясь пойти куда-то еще и записать что-то, вы также не теряете время зря. пытаясь вспомнить то, что, по вашему мнению, вы забыли, единственная проблема в том, что я не могу вспомнить, что я забыл, а затем, когда у вас есть минуты свободного времени, вы можете просто посмотреть на свой список дел и подумать: о, круто, вот это  вещи, которые я уже запечатлел, и это то, что я хочу сделать, и вы можете использовать для этого любое приложение, вы можете использовать ручку и бумагу, вы можете использовать узлы Post-it, вы можете использовать вещи, чтобы сделать это, придумывайте все, что захотите  какое бы приложение ни подходило вам, напоминания Apple, заметки Apple, что бы это ни 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=79)~~  было, на самом деле это не имеет значения, если у вас есть централизованное место, где вы можете записывать свои мысли и идеи, а затем не слишком беспокоиться об этом и тратить время впустую.  время подумать об этом, хорошо, под номером шесть, у нас есть привычка, которая экономит мне около 15 минут каждый день, и это то, что я называю ежедневным приключением, и эта привычка, по сути, заключается в том, что каждое утро я задаю себе вопрос, когда сажусь за  работа, каким будет сегодняшнее приключение сейчас, эта привычка служит двум целям. Основная цель, которая экономит время, состоит в том, что она побуждает меня думать о том, какая моя самая важная задача на день в книге, найдите время, например, где я впервые взял это много много лет назад, когда я читал книгу, они называли ее ежедневным событием, где вы просто спрашиваете себя, что самое важное мне нужно сделать сегодня, и даже если это единственное, что вы делаете в течение дня, пока делаете это в течение 365 дней вы действительно побеждаете и экономите массу времени и 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=119)~~  усилий, а также продвигаетесь к своим целям в течение года. Второе главное преимущество этого заключается в том, что в идеале самое важное, что вы должны сделать, это  быть первым, что вы сделаете в тот день, когда у вас появится немного свободного времени, чтобы это избавило вас от когнитивного бремени, связанного с необходимостью думать о том, что именно мне нужно сделать еще раз, и о третьем преимуществе и причине, по которой я звоню  В наши дни это ежедневное приключение, а не ежедневное событие, потому что, если думать об этом как о приключении, оно кажется немного более увлекательным. Самый большой прием повышения производительности всех времен — это найти способ получать удовольствие от того, что вы делаете, и найти способ  способ генерировать энергию из того, что вы делаете, скажем, у меня есть это, я не знаю, презентация PowerPoint, которую мне нужно закончить, это очень важно, я мог бы думать об этом как о своей самой важной задаче, или я могу думать  об этом как о сегодняшнем приключении, может быть, я бы включил музыку из Гарри Поттера 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=155)~~  на заднем плане, пока я делаю это, чтобы было веселее [Музыка] может быть, я бы сходил в кафе или, может быть, я бы посидел на  скамейка в парке поблизости, если на улице солнечно, как будто есть разные вещи, которые я могу сделать, чтобы приблизиться к этому занятию, которое мне нужно сделать, чтобы немного больше удовольствия, немного больше энергии, немного больше похоже на приключение, хорошо, иду под номером пять  у нас есть еще одна привычка, которая экономит мне около 15 минут в день, и это то, что я называю Радужным календарем, и по сути идея радужного календаря заключается в том, что в идеале каждое утро я хочу планировать свой календарь на остаток дня, и мне нравится  раскрашивать вещи так, чтобы казалось, что это радуга, в которой не так уж много пробелов, потому что проблема с пробелами в календаре заключается в том, что, по крайней мере, я нахожу себя таким человеком, когда у меня есть пробел  в моем календаре, и я не знаю, что собираюсь делать в это время. Я неизбежно трачу это время на что-то непреднамеренное, например, на случайную 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=203)~~  прокрутку Instagram или Tick Tock, и обычно я живу не лучшей жизнью, когда случайно пролистываю Instagram  и Тик-Ток для справки. Я ничего не имею против использования социальных сетей. Я сам профессиональный пользователь социальных сетей, но для себя я хочу, чтобы время, которое я провожу на YouTube, в социальных сетях или где-то еще, было временем, которым я собираюсь быть.  траты на YouTube или социальных сетях или что-то еще, кроме времени, которое я случайно потратил на это, потому что у меня просто не было действия по умолчанию, которым я хотел бы заниматься в это время, поэтому, например, в моем календаре у меня буквально есть блог  каждый день на завтрак блок на работу блок на обед блок на небольшой перерыв иногда блог для прогулки за кофе иногда у меня есть блок, в котором я типа «окей», я просто делаю все, что в этом блоке, но  тогда я хочу, чтобы этот блок был предназначен только для того, чтобы я мог делать все, что я на самом деле пробовал. Я проводил этот эксперимент несколько раз, когда я не блокировал время в 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=242)~~  дневное время, и я обнаружил, что неизбежно все это  подошел около 12 часов, и я такой: ох, ты знаешь, мне сейчас нечего делать, а потом я просто пролистаю Instagram, тем больше это входит в привычку, и чем больше ты следуешь своим собственным намерениям, по крайней мере  Что касается меня, я считаю, что это экономит мне довольно много времени. Я ем около 15 минут в день, хорошо. Под номером четыре — это привычка, которая экономит мне около 20 минут каждый день, и это то, что я называю Правилом пяти минут.  Правило пяти минут состоит из двух компонентов: первый из них заключается в том, что если я изо всех сил пытаюсь что-то сделать, я могу просто начать в течение пяти минут, например, при съемке этого видео я немного откладывал съемку этого видео, но потом подумал, что вы знаете, что  Правило пяти минут Я просто буду снимать видео пять минут, а потом могу остановиться, если захочу, но именно так мы побеждаем прокрастинацию, потому что самое сложное — это начать, это как если бы ты толкал тележку в супермаркете, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=282)~~  это  небольшой толчок, чтобы начать, но как только тележка движется, она просто продолжает двигаться, и теперь я не знаю, что мы снимаем это видео уже 12 минут или сколько бы времени прошло, мне это нравится, сейчас это не так  вещь, от которой мне нужно откладывать, но второй аспект правила пяти минут заключается в том, что пять минут сейчас намного лучше, чем ничего, особенно когда вы организуете свою жизнь с помощью своего календаря, как будто очень легко позволить лайку в час быть единственным  подходящее время, когда вы можете начать что-то вроде: «О, сейчас 11 48», я не могу ничего делать в течение 12 минут до 12, так что я просто подожду до 12, а затем сделаю следующее, когда подумаю  такой образ мышления я трачу много времени, делая что-то непреднамеренно в эти 12 минут, тогда как я обнаруживаю, что с помощью правила пяти минут я говорю себе о, это 12 48 окей, это две порции по пять минут, я мог бы потратить 10 минут на работу над чем-то интересным  это может быть проверка моей электронной почты, это может быть

Я начал есть целебную пищу на пятом курсе медицинской школы, потому что обнаружил это, например, посещая места размещения, пытаясь готовиться к экзаменам, создавая канал на YouTube и бегая.  в моем бизнесе много раз у меня просто не было времени нормально поесть, и поэтому с тех пор, как я начал лечиться, а не отказываться от какой-то нездоровой еды на вынос, я часто ловил себя на мысли, что вы знаете, что, позвольте мне просто взять немного  вылечите и смешайте порошок с небольшим количеством воды и молока, и это будет фантастическая замена завтраку или обеду в наши дни. Мой любимый продукт от Heel — Black Edition, и причина, по которой я люблю Black Edition, заключается в том, что он очень приятный на вкус.  у них отвратительный вкус соленой карамели, а также потому, что в них содержатся невероятные 40 граммов белка на порцию в 400 калорий, и поэтому, чтобы достичь своих последних целей в области здоровья, я работал с тренером по фитнесу, чтобы попытаться набраться

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=440)~~  минут каждый день, и это то, что я  позвоните прямо сейчас на телефон для фокуса. Телефоны — это совершенно невероятное устройство, невероятное изобретение, но они просто тратят время, когда дело доходит до отвлечения нас от вещей, которые мы на самом деле хотим сделать. Большинство из нас намеренно не проводят много времени за телефоном.  мы проводим время за телефоном, поэтому есть три вещи, которые я делаю, чтобы больше сосредоточиться и тратить меньше времени на телефон. Во- первых, мой телефон почти всегда находится в каком-то режиме фокусировки, теперь это происходит автоматически.  потому что я на самом деле блокирую все в своем календаре, и сейчас мой телефон находится в рабочем режиме, а это значит, что я не увижу никаких уведомлений, кроме моей девушки, моей мамы, моего брата и моей невестки, это единственные четыре человека  чьи уведомления приходят, когда мой телефон находится в любом режиме фокусировки, и это означает, что, когда я хочу открыть групповые чаты WhatsApp, я делаю это намеренно в свое время, а не

Во-вторых, я всегда сохраняю  мой телефон экраном вниз, есть что-то в том, чтобы держать телефон экраном вверх перед собой, это как рецепт катастрофы и рецепт отвлечения, и есть что-то в том, что телефон экраном вниз, что делает его гораздо менее угрожающим и намного  менее привлекательное устройство, и третья стратегия, которую я нашел полезной, заключается в том, что, когда у меня бывают периоды, когда я провожу слишком много времени в социальных сетях, я устанавливаю быстрое приложение под названием one sec, но по сути, one sec делает то, что каждый раз, когда вы открываете Instagram  или Tick Tock или YouTube, и вы и вы можете решить, какие именно приложения открываются с помощью этой штуки, и это заставляет вас сделать вдох, а затем снова выдохнуть, а затем он говорит: «Эй, хотите ли вы пойти на Kindle или на звук?»  вместо этого вы можете установить, какие более целенаправленные приложения вы хотите в это время, и обычно к тому времени, когда я трачу несколько секунд, чтобы перевести дух, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=523)~~  снова выдохнуть и спросить себя, действительно ли я хочу зайти в Instagram, верно?  теперь ответ - черт возьми, нет, и тогда я закрываю Instagram, теперь мне так нравится это приложение, что я обратился к парню, который сделал его в Твиттере, и он очень любезно создал ссылку на бесплатную пробную версию только для слота, чтобы она была связана  ниже, если вы хотите проверить это, хорошо, перейдите к привычке номер два, это еще одна привычка, которая экономит мне по крайней мере 30 минут каждый день, иногда на 60 минут, иногда дольше, и это будильник, и по сути идея здесь заключается в использовании  физический будильник в качестве будильника перед сном, а не в телефоне. У меня была эта привычка в течение последних нескольких лет, но я обнаружил, что всякий раз, когда я не использую физический будильник, я думаю: «О, все в порядке, мой телефон»  это мой будильник, это намного проще, чем физический будильник, и мой телефон всегда заряжается у моей кровати, я неизбежно трачу по крайней мере полчаса, иногда час, иногда даже два или три часа, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=564)~~  прежде чем я засну, а затем даже когда я просыпаюсь утром  слишком легко a отложить будильник B отменить будильник и посмотреть, а потом просто лечь в кровать и немного посидеть в телефоне, особенно если утром у меня ничего не было, и теперь у нас есть привычка номер один, которая меня спасает минимум 60 минут каждый день, иногда больше, и это простое правило: мне не разрешается смотреть телевизор, если только это не с друзьями. Это очень спорная вещь. Я знаю, что некоторые люди чувствуют себя на грани религиозности, о боже, мне нужно это иметь  мои два часа просмотра Netflix каждый вечер, потому что если я этого не сделаю, то это очень вредно для моего здоровья, и все это я называю чушью большую часть такого рода вещей. Я так много смотрел телевизор, когда был моложе, я смотрел довольно  много смотрел телевизор в университете, а потом однажды я понял, погоди, я трачу так много времени на просмотр телевизора. Я думаю, что средний американец смотрит телевизор где-то от одного до четырех часов каждый день, для меня это было около 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=606)~~  часа в день  средний уровень, и я понял, что, знаете, когда я был на смертном одре, я, вероятно, не пожалел бы, что не смотрел больше телевизора, и поэтому я попробовал это. Я попробовал установить это правило для себя, когда учился в университете: никакого телевизора, если только он не с друзьями, поэтому, когда игра  «Престолов» выйдет, мы будем проводить вечера «Игры престолов», мы пригласим людей, это будет очень весело, и это превратится в социальный опыт, но это означало, что я не проводил каждый вечер после лекций, наверстывая упущенное.  «Анатомия Грея», или «Дневники вампира», или офис, или просмотр повторов с друзьями, или что-то еще, и это высвободило так много времени в моей жизни в университете, чтобы построить свой бизнес и создать свой канал на YouTube. Я почти никогда не смотрел телевизор, когда работал врачом, поскольку  ну, я бы занимался YouTube по вечерам, и все это было гораздо более полезным и более целенаправленным, чем, например, сидеть и пытаться смотреть телевизор, теперь я знаю, что это 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXP5fUfBGQQ&t=643)~~  спорно, я знаю, что некоторые люди хотят отменить меня за рекламу токсичных веществ продуктивность, суета и все такое, все, что я говорю, это попробуйте исключить телевизор из своей жизни примерно на месяц и посмотреть, скучаете ли вы по нему, и действительно ли вы скучаете по нему, если вы действительно не можете жить без него, если это  на самом деле вы живете своей лучшей жизнью, смотря больше телевизора самостоятельно, сидя на своем компьютере и смотря Netflix, во что бы то ни стало, вы живете своей лучшей жизнью, и вы живете намеренно, но если в моем случае я понял, подождите, я на самом деле нет  горжусь тем временем, которое я провел перед телевизором. Я предпочитаю гулять на природе, а не бегать, а не ходить в спортзал. Итак, в целом эти семь привычек экономят мне по крайней мере три часа каждый день. Надеюсь, вы нашли хотя бы некоторые из них.  они полезны, и вы можете попробовать включить их в свою жизнь, и если вас интересуют дополнительные советы, связанные с продуктивностью, вы можете посмотреть это видео здесь, в котором представлены 12
