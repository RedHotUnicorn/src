In general, with [#datavisualization](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatavisualization&trk=public_post-text), most of the focus is on the graphical elements of the charts—not the typographical elements.

However, when it comes to [#datastorytelling](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatastorytelling&trk=public_post-text), the typographic hierarchy within charts is also important and can’t be overlooked.

The left chart’s text has the same treatment (uniform size and style), and everything is equally important. In some exploratory situations, you want the labels to be uniform, so they don’t steer people in any particular direction.

However, when it comes to explanatory scenarios, you must be more deliberate with the typographic hierarchy. In the right example, it's subtle but the typographic hierarchy helps the audience prioritize what it should pay attention to in the chart.

Headline > Subtitle > Chart title

Key data values > axis labels

Key category label > secondary category labels

When crafting [#data](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdata&trk=public_post-text) charts for your data story, don’t discount how the typographic elements can support your key messages and help your audience interpret the data.

How have you handled the typographic elements of your charts in your data stories?

If the chart belongs in a newspaper, then this kind of highlighting is useful to support the story. If the chart is for everybody in the organization, I have the expectation that the audience is able to read such a simple chart. The headline states the obvious, while the subtitle it's useful as information, but kind of questionable as causality and vague. 

The audience will need more information to establish causality. When were the hires made? In which areas? How many joined the team? 

Also, the number of points is too small for somebody to make such a statement which will not hold when confronted with a deeper analysis of the facts.

It is less probable that the new hires lead to the rebound in such a small timeframe, the integration of new resources taking time until they are able to have an important impact on the sales. Maybe their integration led to the decrease in sales in the first place!

The statement could lead the audience to believe that that's the solution for increasing the sales (which might be true in some cases, but untrue in so many others). On the other side R3's sales seem to increase without new hires. What happens with R2? A review of the backlog or other factors could provide the needed insight.

However, when you explain your numbers to an audience, you must often put them in context.

You may encounter difficult concepts to explain because they are unfamiliar or complex for the audience to understand 🤷🏻.

In these moments, analogies come in handy and are another valuable tool in your data storytelling toolbox 🧰.

An analogy is a comparison between two unlike things that share a resemblance based on a particular aspect. It can help explain or clarify a key point in your data story.

With an analogy, you bridge an abstract or unfamiliar topic with something more concrete or familiar to your audience.

For example, I often use the analogy that data stories must be built on a foundation of relevant and trustworthy data. 

I compare this to a house 🏠 needing a foundation based on good concrete (data quality) and supporting walls in the right places (relevant data) to support the structures above them.

As lawyer and politician Dudley Field Malone said, “One good analogy is worth three hours of discussion.” I firmly believe that.

Analogies are mental shortcuts that can streamline and speed up the intake of your messages. They also make your messages more memorable. If you're not already using analogies in your data stories, I recommend adding them to your toolbox.

How have you used analogies in your data storytelling?

In [#datavisualization](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatavisualization&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text) tips, you’ll often hear that gridlines should be removed or avoided at all costs because they add clutter to [#data](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdata&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text) charts.

While they can add noise to data visualizations, they can also be helpful to people interpreting your charts.

In the accompanying diagram, comparing different values without gridlines is harder, especially when the values are very similar (left column).

When exploring the data, the gridlines can serve as valuable reference lines as you compare different values (middle column).

It can be difficult to interpret the data values furthest from the scales on the x- or y-axes.

In the case of the top right bar chart example, you don’t need the gridlines (or axis labels) if the data values are already labeled. The gridlines are redundant and represent clutter.

In the bottom right scatterplot example, the gridlines could be useful or clutter, depending on the situation and what you’re trying to communicate.

The gridlines might help the audience assess the highlighted results more quickly but could also end up distracting them.

If you choose to use gridlines, you’ll want to be mindful of the following:

👉  Use a subtle color (e.g., light gray) to not overpower the data
👉  Use a thin line thickness to not dominate the plot area of the chart
👉  Make sure the unit scale is appropriate (not too dense with multiple gridlines)
👉  Limit gridlines (horizontal vs. vertical) to those that are essential

Like other tools in your [#datastorytelling](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatastorytelling&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text) toolbox, you must apply your best judgment on whether gridlines help or hinder your messaging. Ultimately, if they help your audience interpret your data more quickly or more accurately, they may be quite useful and not just clutter.

In what other situations do you choose to use or not use gridlines?

Last week, after delivering a presentation on [#datastorytelling](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatastorytelling&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text) to a group of statisticians, someone in the audience raised an interesting concern.

A statistician was worried that by making his data stories more streamlined and simple, his audiences may feel they were easy or straightforward to produce.

In the future, his audiences would underestimate how much time and effort he invested in them.

One of the things I frequently emphasize is the need to simplify and streamline what you communicate to your audiences.

Many [#data](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdata&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text) and [#analytics](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fanalytics&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text) professionals want to be comprehensive and “show their work,” which can bog down the audience with unnecessary detail.

I often use a cake-baking analogy to explain why that isn’t a good approach. Most audiences don’t want to hear how you made the cake. They don’t care about any of the following:

❎ What recipe you followed
❎ What ingredients you used (unless there’s a food allergy, of course)
❎ What tools you used
❎ What steps you took
❎ How much time or effort was required
❎ What issues you ran into and overcame

Your audience just wants to eat a slice of your cake. In other words, they want to gain a meaningful insight—and quickly.

Communicating your insights clearly and concisely will often trump the need to be comprehensive or ‘flex’ how much work went into your data story. 

In some situations, you may need to be more comprehensive about certain aspects, but overall, you strive to make your stories as concise as possible.

If you need to flex on the effort, you can do that in your appendix—never in your story.

You can be both concise (story) and comprehensive (appendix). If you distill the essence of your findings into 10 slides based on a clear narrative, that doesn’t prevent you from having 40-60 slides in your appendix.

Mathematician Blaise Pascal said, “I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.” Data presentations are frequently longer than needed because the presenter lacks the time or skill to make them more succinct.

Most audience members will appreciate the effort spent crafting a CONCISE data story. For those who don’t, you can take them through the COMPREHENSIVE supporting details in your appendix.

How do you balance being concise with being comprehensive?

Happy May the Fourth 2024! Every year I share my article on six lessons we can learn from [#starwars](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fstarwars&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text) about [#data](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdata&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text) and [#analytics](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fanalytics&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text). I was originally going to publish this on Forbes, but it was the only article that the editors rejected. I don’t think they actually read it. I feel the lessons are solid. Enjoy!

I ended up with 27 pages of notes from a book that’s only 322 pages long. Can you believe the goldmine of wisdom that book turned out to be?

Shout out to [Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thefpandaguy?trk=public_post_main-feed-card_reshare-text) and [Ron](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ronmonteiro18?trk=public_post_main-feed-card_reshare-text) for introducing me to this book during the FP&A Training course! Forever grateful for the awesome course and this amazing recommendation.

The book is none other than 
✨ “Effective Data Storytelling: How to Drive Change With Data, Narrative and Visuals” by [Brent Dykes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentdykes?trk=public_post_main-feed-card_reshare-text) ✨ 

If you weren't sold on the power of data storytelling before, this book will definitely change your mind. Coming from an Investor Relations and Strategy background, I already knew how impactful effective data storytelling and visualization techniques can be. But Brent really takes it to the next level with the elements he introduces here. It's clear he's a master storyteller himself!

One of the initial draws for me with this book was its focus on the power of combining data, narrative, and visuals, beautifully articulated as:
🌟 Data and Narrative – Explains, 
🌟 Data and Visuals – Enlightens, 
🌟 Narrative and Visuals – Engages
“When you combine the right visuals and narrative with the right data, you have a data story that can influence and drive change”

Indeed, this structure serves as the bedrock of Brent’s book. In the initial three chapters, Brent lays out the WHYs of data storytelling. From there, we plunge into the HOWs, organized around Data, Narrative, and Visuals. Each of these components plays a vital role in crafting a compelling story, and Brent expertly guides us through the process. 

The chapters brim with anecdotes, frameworks, principles, and real-life examples, making our learning journey more efficient and engaging. What I find particularly valuable is that the book not only instructs us on what to do but also alerts us to common pitfalls to avoid when crafting our narratives hastily.

In the final chapter, Brent shares few examples showcasing the power of compelling data stories. It ties together all the key lessons from the book in a way that’s bound to leave you impressed.

Effective Data Storytelling is a must-read for everyone. It highlights the profound impact stories can have on us and shows how integrating them into our communication can revolutionize how we share information. By adopting these techniques, we can significantly improve the clarity, impact, and memorability of our presentations, reports, and communications. 

Armed with the insights from "Effective Data Storytelling," I'm eager to infuse my future roles with compelling narratives, impactful visuals, and insightful data to drive change and foster engagement.

From time to time, it may be necessary to feature a complex data chart in your data stories.

However, that doesn’t mean you need to highlight all your takeaways in a single data scene simultaneously.

Using an “everything, everywhere, all-at-once” approach increases the likelihood of overloading your audience with too much information.

The more loaded a chart becomes with different highlights and callouts, the less easy it will be for them to follow and make sense of it.

In [#datastorytelling](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatastorytelling&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text), breaking up the information into separate ‘micro’ scenes often makes more sense. You can then focus on different areas or parts of a complex chart—one at a time in a staged manner.

The main advantage of the staged approach is that you can better manage how your audience processes your content. You don’t overwhelm them with too much, too fast.

You can ensure your audience understands each aspect before moving on to the next focus area. The key points you make don’t interfere with each other; they can instead build on each other.

Some people will push back on this approach because, in this example, it would turn one slide into three slides. However, in most cases, the number of slides is irrelevant. What matters is how much time you take to present the content.

Even though there are more slides, the three simplified ‘micro’ data scenes will be faster to present and easier to explain than one busy, complicated data scene.

The staged approach also ensures that your messaging is crisp and focused.

Have you successfully staged your content so it’s easier for your audience to follow?

If you work in [#data](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdata&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text), you’ll often hear the admonition, "Correlation doesn't imply causation."

A popular analogy to explain the correlation-causation fallacy is the strong correlation between ice cream consumption and shark attacks.

While it is a fun example that shows how people can overlook a third factor (hot weather), there is a real historical example of the correlation-causation fallacy that has existed for over 2,000 years.

Today, we understand that infectious diseases are caused by germs such as bacteria and viruses.

However, from the fourth century BC (Hippocrates) until the late nineteenth century, doctors believed diseases were spread through bad air.

The medical community embraced this theory, known as the Miasma Theory, when they noticed a strong correlation between disease and bad odors.

They found that many diseases were concentrated near foul-smelling swamps, trash, sewage, and decaying corpses.
 
The sinister-looking plague masks' long beaks held perfumes and incense so the doctors could be “protected” from infectious vapors.

This theory is also influenced the name malaria, which means “bad air” (“mal aria”) in medieval Italian.

In the early nineteenth century, living conditions in industrialized cities in Britain became increasingly unsanitary. To address the foul air problems caused by urbanization and human waste accumulation, the Miasma Theory inspired the introduction of massive sewer systems.

These sanitation projects were able to quell the number of epidemics and reduce mortality rates, reinforcing the medical community’s belief in the Miasma Theory.

Eventually, in the 1880s, the work of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch revealed the true source of disease (germs), and the Miasma Theory was abandoned.

What lessons can we take from this historical example for [#analytics](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fanalytics&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text)?

👉  Be careful to distinguish between causal relationships and correlations
👉  Highlight your assumptions and the potential data limitations
👉  Keep an open mind and seek out instances that challenge the prevailing theories
👉  Don’t assume positive results mean you’ve identified and addressed the root cause

How do you ensure you don’t fall for the correlation-causation fallacy?

Recently, I was reviewing some client presentations for a [#datastorytelling](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatastorytelling&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text) training session.

I noticed that the analyst had used a dashed or dotted line to highlight or emphasize a particular data series.

While highlighting a data series or variable in a chart is an important visual storytelling practice, I don’t recommend using dashed or dotted lines to add emphasis.

Instead, dashed or dotted line formatting should be reserved for the following special purposes:

👉  Estimates or projections. You can differentiate historical data (solid) from forecasted data (dashed). The dashed lines indicate a level of uncertainty.

👉 Targets or thresholds. You may want to overlay a goal or threshold line on your chart. You can differentiate this information with dashed or dotted lines.

👉  Calculations and other special purposes. You may include calculated metrics and features on your charts, such as averages, trendlines, or quadrant lines. Typically, they represent supplemental or secondary information, so using a dashed or dotted line reduces their prominence.

In the past, before color printing, it was common to see line formatting used to differentiate data series in black-and-white scenarios.

With more color printing options and less need to print our charts (digital consumption), we don’t need to rely on the line formatting as much for differentiation.

I recommend not using dashed or dotted lines for highlighting and limiting their usage to the special purposes I’ve outlined.

Are there other special purposes where dashed or dotted lines make sense?

In [#datastorytelling](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatastorytelling&trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text), context is an integral ingredient in data stories.

Without proper or adequate context, your audience will have a harder time understanding the numbers you’re sharing.

In addition, it will also be difficult for your audience to appreciate the full significance of your insights without ample context.

I liken the role of context in a data story to the condiments and other ingredients added to a hamburger.

While a hamburger can comprise just a meat patty and bun, it will be bland without additional ingredients.

The sauces, cheese, bacon (!), onions, pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce dramatically enhance the hamburger's flavor.

Similarly, you’ll want to enrich your data stories with ample context.

In a past blog post ([https://lnkd.in/gxE\_zN3d](https://lnkd.in/gxE_zN3d?trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text)), I discuss six different types of context you can add to your data points:

1️⃣ Comparative: How does it compare to other related values?
2️⃣ Historical: How does it compare to past performance?
3️⃣ Scaled (Up/down): What combined effect could it have if it continues?
4️⃣ Informational: What other factors (internal/external) may have been influential?
5️⃣ Equivalent: Is there a more relatable interpretation?
6️⃣ Confirmative: Do the numbers need to be verified or validated?

Nobody likes a bland burger. Besides a high-quality patty and bun, the extra ingredients often separate an average burger from a truly amazing one.

Likewise, don’t forget the importance that added context has on enriching your data stories, making them more engaging, memorable, and persuasive.

What’s your favorite way of leveraging context in your data stories?

Yesterday, I published a new blog post ([https://lnkd.in/gh9Yj-xU](https://lnkd.in/gh9Yj-xU?trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text)) that examines what data storytelling lessons we can learn from comic books.

Why comic books? From a visual storytelling perspective, data stories have more in common with comic books than other storytelling mediums.

They’re both static, sequential narratives that tell their stories using a balanced combination of words and visuals.

In this post, I’d like to focus on the use of compression and decompression in comic books and how you can use them to control the pacing of our data stories.

COMPRESSION ➡ ⬅️

Like a data story, a comic book doesn’t cover every facet of the entire narrative. It provides meaningful glimpses into the most important and entertaining parts that move the story forward.

Looking at the three comic book panels on the left, you’re introduced to the superhero’s alter ego. He hears a call for help and begins changing into his superhero gear. Then, we see the hero running to respond to the plea for help.

What’s missing? The mundane or repetitive bits that don’t matter to the story.

👉 Do we need to see him take out the garbage? No.
👉 Do we need to see him put on his cape? No.
👉 Do we need to see him checking a spam text message on his phone before running to help? No.

Likewise, the data scenes don’t need to show every possible slice or detail of the data, especially if they’re irrelevant to your key takeaways or messages.

DECOMPRESSION ⬅ ➡ 

In comic books, the opposite approach of decompression pacing is also used strategically. A decompressed approach spreads a key moment in the story across multiple similar panels with few accompanying words.

This approach adds more weight to small but significant moments in the story to enhance the overall emotion and tension.

The three comic book panels on the right progressively focus on the superhero and end with a close-up of her determined expression.

At times in data storytelling, you may want to use a decompression approach to slow down and unpack an essential part of your story that is crucial to your audience’s understanding.

For example, you may spend more time on a key dataset by focusing on different clusters of results in a scatterplot—one at a time, not all at once.

While you’ll mainly use a compression approach, a decompression approach may be useful for pacing key parts of your story. If you'd like to learn more data storytelling skills like this, check out my book: [https://lnkd.in/gzs2EZb](https://lnkd.in/gzs2EZb?trk=public_post_main-feed-card-text)
