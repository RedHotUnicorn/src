 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=5)~~  hi everyone welcome back to our ongoing series on how to create a life operating system today i'm going to share my thoughts on the option of using obsidian or some other platform for the purpose of knowledge management in a life operating system that's otherwise all built in notion i do a lot of q a live streams in my course on notion life design and this is a topic that's been coming up more and more so i wanted to share a clip from one of those q a live streams where i share my perspective on it and hopefully this can be the start of a longer conversation where we can explore other software platforms that might be an option to plug into our notion life design system we can use the comments below to start that conversation so i definitely want to hear your thoughts i'll kick it off with my take on it and if this is of interest we can do more videos in the future on this topic expanding the realm of options for the life design system that we've been building i also just announced plans for a new course i'm going to be launching called notion for 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=58)~~  teams at notion for teams dot io that's going to be how to implement the team's version of the pillars pipelines and vault system so if that's of interest you can sign up for updates on that at the link in the show notes below i also have a lot of new videos in the pipeline for this channel i think the next one will probably be on focus my most effective approach to focus that of course ties into everything we've been doing with our daily action zone in the ppv system this one will be touching more on the practice of focus as a discipline as a skill as a muscle to build so we'll get into that in future videos coming up soon if that's of interest be sure to subscribe to the channel hit the bell icon to get notifications of updates now let's dive into some thoughts on the comparison of using obsidian versus notion for the purpose of knowledge management in the context of a larger more comprehensive life operating system is it possible to be successful knowledgeable outside of notion okay that's a very good question 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=112)~~  let's start with that it is certainly possible to be successful with a knowledgeable outside of notion and lately there have been a few people using obsidian for that it can be done with evernote it can't be done with other systems i would say there are really strong inherent systemic benefits to having a single system under one roof on one platform when you start using other platforms for the knowledge vault alone you get some unique benefits of those platforms every platform has pros and cons but you lose the emergence that comes from a single integrated system and so i would highly recommend at least starting out to do it in notion get familiar with notion then you can try others and compare it to notion but if the rest of your system is in notion and then you have a siloed knowledge vault separately first of all it's going to be more manual work to bridge between them you're not going to have things resurfacing in context as easily or nearly as easily and that's the reason that i believe the ppv knowledge vault system is more powerful than any 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=174)~~  other system i've ever seen on any other platform because of the resurfacing in context and that can only really happen if all the contexts are under the same umbrella and interconnected so that things can bubble up in the right location at the right time and place because they're speaking to each other and they're referencing each other if you have an obsidian database you are not going to have the resurfacing and context now i will say so though so i don't see any real value in doing it in evernote or docs or anywhere that's just traditional old-school style note-taking so there is this new kind of note-taking or platform that rome and obsidian represent this is sort of a networked thought idea and there is a benefit to that over an ocean and then there are well actually several benefits of notion over that so let me talk about the pros and cons of these two types of systems for knowledge faults since the topic came up and this is has been a popular topic getting into the networked thought approach versus the notion 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=234)~~  approach so again notion is going to enable resurfacing in context because you're all of the contexts of your system are already in notion in ppv so that's not going to be doable in obsidian and to me that right there is the most powerful part of a knowledge of all the resurfacing and context but if you are drawn to the appeal of this serendipitous networked thought idea so the idea of those network thought platforms which is roman obsidian and an increasing number of copycats i mean rome started at obsidian's a copycat the rest are copycats but obsidian's free and rome has become expensive so obsidian has taken over in popularity so the advantage is you have as you enter things they're effortlessly connecting to other things in the system and they create a really nice visual network view of hubs and spokes and connectivity across all these thoughts and ideas it's really cool and it's really valuable in that it creates a serendipity where you have ideas connecting in ways that you wouldn't have thought on your own that you get sort of 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=296)~~  surprise connections and really that's one of the real strengths of strengths or ways to be creative the central way to be creative is not to come up with really original ideas it's the connect unusual ideas or what i call unusual associations and that's really how most creativity happens so the ability to have unexpected connections generated by the platform is really cool and valuable the problem is it creates a big mess that you can't find what you're looking for so you get the surprise discoveries but you don't have a very good organization and it's hard to find what you're looking for whereas in notion you can find what you're looking for because it's very systematic and structured but it doesn't have as many surprise connections however because it does have the resurfacing in context first of all it will remind you of things that you had intended to bring together that you would normally forget and you will much more easily forget in obsidian or rome because we have this and this is not native to notion this is really specific 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=358)~~  design and ppv this is what sets ppv apart from even other notion systems is the resurfacing in context so it's going to help you remember to bring in things that you had at one point thought would be good connections which to me is the single most valuable thing because that's going to also help you be creative your previous ideas will continue to live and they won't be forgotten and disappear because the connectivity wasn't there you can you will have some serendipitous discovery through this resurfacing as well because when you sit down to work in a knowledgeable topic you'll be diving into the topic and even things that you connected to this broad category but didn't really think about how to use them by them resurfacing in the context of this topic and i mean articles you captured thoughts you jotted down you will be able to re-examine them in new ways in the broader context of the topic so you get some of that but you do get more of the serendipity in the network thought platforms some people value that more than 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=410)~~  anything that's fine that's legitimate choice uh they are cool they are interesting they work well for that one function the other problem though i see with the network thought platforms is at first it's nice because you get this connectivity but as you add more and more and more the clutter in lines connecting all of them becomes just more and more complex and i have heard from many people who when i was using rome i encountered this and then i've heard from many people who used it way beyond me that it just becomes too bloated and cumbersome and you can't make any sense out of this incredible spiderweb of connections so it also seems to have a scaling limit whereas our ppv system scales beautifully bigger and bigger and bigger over the years and years and years you might be using it so i think that the notion ppv system has the power that is unparalleled by any other notion system i've ever seen or any other platform however if you really want to value this unique serendipitous connection then there is an advantage to the network 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=467)~~  thought now you might use the network thought approach on roman obsidian for a specific research project say you're you know researching a topic that's new to you and you might put all of your thinking and media in there and just see how it links together that's keeping it more contained and that might be a more effective approach and then perhaps you migrate the best nuggets or insights over back over to knowledgeable i don't know then it becomes a two-platform maintenance system which again is a problem that was the other thing because they're not connected these none of these platforms have good apis that connect with each other or any native integrations whatsoever so you become a manager managing this bridge between them which i also found cumbersome so those are my thoughts on that i don't think you're going to find a more effective system than ppv and notion anywhere but if you really want to value unexpected discoveries then you might consider the network thought ones just know you're giving up a lot in terms of our integrated system to get 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=528)~~  that so always trade-offs there we go long long explanation but that is something that's been coming up a lot so it's good that we touched on that good question i wonder if the api will allow for syncing or if notion will build a visualization tool at some point it would be i hope there's some kind of api integration for syncing i've talked to some developers about this and they say there is a foundational structural difference to notion and traditional databases and the network thought tools like roman obsidian there is apparently i'm not a developer so i can't speak to this with any great depth but there is a foundational difference in how they're built from the ground up that play to the strengths and weaknesses of each so it's not merely a matter of notion adding this feature which is what i thought it was in the beginning some of the features can be added and notion is closing the gap notion that has added backlinks and well the backlink list and then inline links to other pages which then form a backlink it's not as good but it's a 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=591)~~  step closer and they have other features in the roadmap that will close the gap that differentiates them but i don't think we're going to have the full i don't think notion will ever fully catch up in that regard because as i'm told there is foundational structure that enables it particularly when it comes to the visualization so i agree it would be really nice to have that it seems to me it could be done within a single database it'd be hard across multiple databases but that's what i'm told so that's everything i know in that topic but it would be nice i agree the further they close the the gap the better and they have closed the gap a lot since rome first launched so i mean rome's not getting closer to notion but notions getting closer to the feature set of rome also i mean rome does roman obsidian do what three or four percent of what notion does and notion does what 75 or 80 of what roman obsidian do so again choose your weapon how would you create a zettle system in the knowledge vault i looked at the zettle system and it just 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=652)~~  seemed overly complex for what we're trying to achieve and i didn't see anything it achieved that we don't already have in ppv so i know it tends to be associated with the network thought applications but as i reviewed article after article about settle casting i didn't see it doing anything that we didn't already have so you know it was made popular by this book taking smart notes uh which i've skimmed as well so yeah i mean you can it's it's all the same it's tagging and associating notes with different topics dental casting has various stages of notes and the process of doing this stage and then redoing this note and then redoing this note seemed excessive for me and i think for most people so if you're working on a note repeatedly fine but i wouldn't go out of your way to just be organizing notes for the sake of organizing notes to have this beautiful master system work on them as you need to work on each knowledgeable topic as you have a need to dive into it if you have a project that requires it or a presentation or 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=717)~~  or you're just really curious and you want to spend some time on the topic like that's your recreationist to explore that topic that's a reason but i wouldn't be organizing knowledge of all topics or your zedelkeson note system just because it would be cool to have it organized like work on each note and each topic as you have a need or desire to explore that topic so do it as needed rather than as a big maintenance project because as a maintenance project it's going to become so burdensome and cumbersome and such a chore it's not going to sustain so use it as needed across all of the system so those are my thoughts there it's a cool system and if you're really engaged with that range of notes at that level like you're researching a book for example i could see doing that because then you're going to be need to go through them thoroughly multiple times reorganize them massively so i could see as that'll custom system implemented for a specific big scale project but to do it comprehensively on everything in your knowledge vault is just way too much 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=781)~~  it's too much time it's too much burden so you know apply it selectively where it can give you the biggest payoff all right great questions you guys are super on top of the stuff

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=5)~~  привет всем, добро пожаловать обратно в нашу продолжающуюся серию статей о том, как создать жизненную операционную систему. Сегодня я поделюсь своими мыслями о возможности использования Obsidian или какой-либо другой платформы с целью управления знаниями в жизненной операционной системе, которая  в остальном все встроено в идею, я провожу много прямых трансляций q a в своем курсе по дизайну концептуальной жизни, и эта тема возникает все чаще и чаще, поэтому я хотел поделиться отрывком из одной из таких прямых трансляций q a, где я делюсь своими  взгляд на это, и, надеюсь, это может стать началом более длительного разговора, в ходе которого мы сможем изучить другие программные платформы, которые можно будет подключить к нашей системе проектирования жизни. Мы можем использовать комментарии ниже, чтобы начать этот разговор, поэтому я определенно хочу услышать  ваши мысли, я начну со своего взгляда на это, и если это будет интересно, мы можем сделать больше видео в будущем на эту тему, расширяя сферу возможностей системы проектирования жизни, которую 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=53)~~  мы создаем, я также только что объявил  планы на новый курс, который я собираюсь запустить под названием notion for Teams at notion for Teams dot io, в нем будет рассказано о том, как реализовать командную версию конвейеров Pills и системы хранилищ, так что, если это вас интересует, вы можете подписаться на обновления  об этом по ссылке в примечаниях к шоу ниже, у меня также есть много новых видео для этого канала, я думаю, что следующий, вероятно, будет в фокусе, мой самый эффективный подход к фокусу, который, конечно, связан со всем, что мы были Что касается нашей зоны ежедневных действий в системе PPV, в этом видео мы будем больше затрагивать практику сосредоточения как дисциплину, как навык, как мышцу, которую нужно наращивать, поэтому мы займемся этим в будущих видеороликах, которые скоро появятся, если это будет интересно.  обязательно подпишитесь на канал, нажмите на значок колокольчика, чтобы получать уведомления об обновлениях, теперь давайте углубимся в некоторые мысли о сравнении использования обсидиана и понятия для 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=101)~~  целей управления знаниями в контексте более крупной и всеобъемлющей операционной системы жизни, возможно ли быть успешным, обладая знаниями за пределами представлений, окей, это очень хороший вопрос, давайте начнем с того, что, безусловно, можно добиться успеха, обладая знаниями за пределами представлений, и в последнее время некоторые люди используют обсидиан, чтобы это можно было сделать с помощью Evernote, это возможно'  С другими системами покончено, я бы сказал, что наличие одной системы под одной крышей на одной платформе действительно дает серьезные системные преимущества. Когда вы начинаете использовать другие платформы только для хранилища знаний, вы получаете некоторые уникальные преимущества этих платформ. У каждой платформы есть плюсы.  и минусы, но вы теряете платформы есть плюсы.  и минусы, но вы теряете эффект, который исходит от единой интегрированной системы, поэтому я настоятельно рекомендую хотя бы начать делать это в понятии. Ознакомьтесь с понятием, затем вы можете попробовать другие и сравнить его с 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=155)~~  понятием, но если остальная часть вашей системы  это в идее, и тогда у вас будет отдельное хранилище знаний, прежде всего, потребуется больше ручной работы, чтобы соединить их, у вас не будет возможности всплывать на поверхность в контексте так же легко или почти так же легко, и это причина, по которой я верю система хранилища знаний ppv более мощная, чем любая другая система, которую я когда-либо видел на любой другой платформе, из-за обновления контекста, и это действительно может произойти только в том случае, если все контексты находятся под одной крышей и взаимосвязаны, так что все может всплывать.  в нужном месте, в нужное время и в нужном месте, потому что они разговаривают друг с другом и ссылаются друг на друга, если у вас есть база данных обсидиана, у вас не будет обновлений и контекста, сейчас я так и скажу, но я не хочу  Я не вижу никакой реальной ценности в том, чтобы делать это в Evernote, документах или где-либо еще, где это просто традиционное ведение заметок в стиле старой школы, поэтому существует новый вид 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=211)~~  ведения заметок или платформа, которую представляют Рим и Обсидиан, это своего рода сетевая идея  и в этом есть преимущество по сравнению с океаном, и на самом деле есть несколько преимуществ по сравнению с этим, поэтому позвольте мне поговорить о плюсах и минусах этих двух типов систем для устранения ошибок в знаниях, поскольку эта тема возникла, и это было популярная тема, посвященная сетевому мыслительному подходу в сравнении с концептуальным подходом, так что снова понятие позволит включить повторное всплывание в контексте, потому что все контексты вашей системы уже находятся в понятии в ppv, так что это не будет выполнимо в обсидиане и  для меня это самая мощная часть знаний обо всех проявлениях и контексте, но если вас привлекает привлекательность этой случайной сетевой мыслительной идеи, тогда идея тех сетевых мыслительных платформ, которые представляют собой римский обсидиан и растущее число  подражатели, я имею в виду, что Рим начался с обсидиана, подражатель, остальные - подражатели, но обсидиан бесплатен, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=267)~~  а Рим стал дорогим, поэтому обсидиан завоевал популярность, так что преимущество в том, что у вас есть преимущество, когда вы вводите вещи, которые они легко соединяют с другими вещами в системе и  они создают действительно хорошее визуальное сетевое представление концентраторов, спиц и связей всех этих мыслей и идей. Это действительно круто и действительно ценно, поскольку создает счастливую случайность, когда у вас есть идеи, соединяющиеся таким образом, о котором вы даже не подумали бы сами.  что вы получаете своего рода неожиданные связи, и на самом деле это одна из сильных сторон или способов проявить творческий подход. Главный способ проявить творческий подход - это не придумывать действительно оригинальные идеи, а соединять необычные идеи или то, что я называю необычными ассоциациями, и это  на самом деле, как происходит большая часть творчества, поэтому возможность иметь неожиданные связи, генерируемые платформой, действительно круто и ценно, проблема в том, что это создает большой беспорядок, из-за которого вы не можете найти то, что ищете, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=322)~~  поэтому вы получаете неожиданные открытия, но не делаете этого.  У меня нет очень хорошей организации, и трудно найти то, что вы ищете, тогда как теоретически вы можете найти то, что ищете, потому что это очень систематично и структурировано, но в нем не так много неожиданных связей, потому что это так.  в первую очередь используйте всплытие в контексте, оно напомнит вам о вещах, которые вы намеревались объединить, которые вы обычно забываете, и вам гораздо легче забыть обсидиан или рим, потому что у нас есть это, и это не является или рим, потому что у нас есть это, и это не является родным для понятия, это  действительно специфический дизайн и ppv — это то, что отличает ppv даже от других систем понятий, — это всплывание контекста, поэтому оно поможет вам не забыть привнести вещи, которые, как вы когда-то думали, будут хорошими связями, что для меня является наиболее  ценная вещь, потому что это также поможет вам проявить творческий подход, ваши предыдущие идеи будут продолжать жить, и они не будут забыты и исчезнут, потому что 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=378)~~  связи не было, вы также можете сделать какое-то счастливое открытие благодаря этому всплытию на поверхность, потому что, когда вы сядьте за работу над знакомой темой, вы будете погружаться в нее и даже в вещи, которые вы отнесли к этой широкой категории, но на самом деле не думали о том, как их использовать, всплывая на поверхность в контексте этой темы, и я имею в виду статьи  вы уловили мысли, которые вы записали, вы сможете пересмотреть их по-новому в более широком контексте темы, так что вы получите кое-что из этого, но вы получите больше случайности на сетевых мыслительных платформах, некоторые люди ценят это больше, чем все, что хорошо, это законный выбор, ну, они крутые, они интересные, они хорошо работают для этой одной функции, другая проблема, хотя я вижу, что с сетевыми платформами поначалу это хорошо, потому что вы получаете эту возможность подключения, но по мере того, как вы добавляете все больше и больше и больше  беспорядок в линиях, соединяющих их все, становится все более и более сложным, и я слышал от многих людей, что, когда я 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=433)~~  использовал rome, я столкнулся с этим, а затем я слышал от многих людей, которые использовали его намного дальше меня, что это становится слишком раздутая и громоздкая, и вы не можете найти никакого смысла в этой невероятной паутине связей, поэтому кажется, что у нее также есть предел масштабирования, тогда как наша система PPV прекрасно масштабируется все больше и больше и больше с годами, годами и годами, когда вы можете ее использовать  поэтому я думаю, что система понятий ppv обладает мощью, не имеющей аналогов ни у одной другой системы понятий, которую я когда-либо видел, или любой другой платформы, однако, если вы действительно хотите оценить эту уникальную случайную связь, тогда у сети есть преимущество, подумайте, теперь вы  можете использовать подход сетевого мышления к римскому обсидиану для конкретного исследовательского проекта. Скажите, что вы знаете, что исследуете новую для вас тему, и вы можете поместить туда все свои мысли и средства массовой информации и просто посмотреть, как они связаны друг с другом, что делает их 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=482)~~  более интересными.  содержаться в себе, и это может быть более эффективным подходом, а затем, возможно, вы переносите лучшие самородки или идеи обратно в знающих, я не знаю, тогда это становится двухплатформенной системой обслуживания, что опять же является проблемой, которая была другой вещью, потому что они  не связаны между собой, ни одна из этих платформ не имеет хороших API, которые соединяются друг с другом или каких-либо встроенных интеграций, поэтому вы становитесь менеджером, управляющим этим мостом между ними, который я также нашел громоздким, так что это мои мысли по этому поводу, я не думаю, что вы  Я собираюсь найти где-нибудь более эффективную систему, чем PPV и Notion, но если вы действительно хотите ценить неожиданные открытия, тогда вы можете рассмотреть сетевую систему, которая просто знает, что вы от многого отказываетесь с точки зрения нашей интегрированной системы, чтобы получить это так  всегда идут компромиссы, мы идем долго и подробно объясняем, но это то, что часто возникает, поэтому хорошо, что мы затронули этот хороший 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=535)~~  вопрос, мне интересно, позволит ли API синхронизироваться или в какой-то момент Notion создаст инструмент визуализации было бы, я надеюсь, что есть какая-то интеграция API для синхронизации. Я говорил об этом с некоторыми разработчиками, и они говорят, что существует фундаментальное структурное различие между понятием и традиционными базами данных и инструментами сетевого мышления, такими как римский обсидиан, очевидно, я  Я не разработчик, поэтому я не могу говорить об этом с какой-либо глубокостью, но есть фундаментальная разница в том, как они построены с нуля, которые учитывают сильные и слабые стороны каждого, так что это не просто вопрос добавления этого  функция, о которой я думал вначале, некоторые функции могут быть добавлены, и идея закрывает пробел, концепция, которая добавляет обратные ссылки, а также список обратных ссылок, а затем встроенные ссылки на другие страницы, которые затем образуют обратную ссылку, это не так хорошо  но это на шаг ближе, и у них есть другие функции в дорожной карте, которые устранят разрыв, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=594)~~  который их отличает, но я не думаю, что мы получим полную информацию, я не думаю, что понятие когда-либо полностью догонит их в этом отношении, потому что  как мне сказали, существует основополагающая структура, которая позволяет это, особенно когда дело доходит до визуализации, поэтому я согласен, что было бы очень хорошо иметь то, что, как мне кажется, можно было бы сделать в рамках одной базы данных, это было бы сложно использовать в нескольких базах данных. но это то, что мне сказали, так что это все, что я знаю по этой теме, но было бы неплохо, я согласен, чем дальше они сокращают разрыв, тем лучше, и они значительно сократили разрыв с момента первого запуска Рима, так что я имею в виду, что Рим не приближается  к понятию, но понятия становятся ближе к набору функций Рима, также я имею в виду, что Рим делает римский обсидиан, что три или четыре процента того, что делает понятие, и понятие делает, что делают 75 или 80 того, что делает римский обсидиан, так что еще раз выберите свое оружие, как бы вы создали система zettle в хранилище знаний. Я 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=650)~~  посмотрел на систему zettle, и она показалась мне слишком сложной для того, чего мы пытаемся достичь, и я не увидел в ней ничего такого, чего еще нет в ppv, поэтому я знаю, что это имеет тенденцию  быть связанным с приложениями сетевого мышления, но когда я просматривал статью за статьей об урегулировании кастинга, я не видел, чтобы оно делало что-то, чего у нас еще не было, так что вы знаете, что эта книга сделала его популярным благодаря умным заметкам, что я'  Я тоже просмотрел, так что да, я имею в виду, что вы можете, это все равно, что помечает и связывает заметки с разными темами. В стоматологической слепке есть разные этапы заметок, и процесс выполнения этого этапа, а затем переделывание этой заметки, а затем переделывание этой заметки показалось чрезмерным для  Я и я думаем, что для большинства людей, если вы постоянно работаете над заметкой, это хорошо, но я бы не стал изо всех сил стараться просто систематизировать заметки ради организации заметок, чтобы эта прекрасная мастер-система работала над ними, пока вы  вам нужно 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=707)~~  работать над каждой хорошо осведомленной темой, так как вам нужно погрузиться в нее, если у вас есть проект, который требует этого, или презентация, или вам просто очень любопытно, и вы хотите потратить некоторое время на эту тему, как будто это ваш любитель отдыха изучить эту тему, это причина, но я бы не стал систематизировать знания по всем темам или вашей системе заметок зеделькесон только потому, что было бы здорово организовать ее, например работу над каждой заметкой и каждой темой, поскольку у вас есть потребность или желание изучить это  эту тему, поэтому делайте это по мере необходимости, а не как большой проект обслуживания, потому что как проект обслуживания он станет настолько обременительным и громоздким, и такой рутинной работой, что его невозможно будет поддерживать, поэтому используйте его по мере необходимости во всей системе, таковы мои мысли это классная система, и если вы действительно увлечены этим диапазоном заметок на этом уровне, например, вы исследуете книгу, я мог бы сделать это, потому что 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPxg4osmji8&t=764)~~  тогда вам нужно будет тщательно просмотреть их несколько раз реорганизовать их массово, чтобы я мог видеть, как эта специальная система будет реализована для конкретного крупномасштабного проекта, но делать это комплексно для всего в вашем хранилище знаний - это слишком много, это слишком много времени, это слишком большая нагрузка, поэтому вы знаете, применяйте ее выборочно  где это может принести вам самую большую выгоду, хорошо, отличные вопросы, ребята, вы супер в теме
