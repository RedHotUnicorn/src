# Description 
"Getting Things Done", often referred to as simply "GTD" is a framework for organising your life to achieve stress-free productivity.

In this video, I break down the core parts of GTD that I integrated into my personal workflows.

🤓 LOGSEQ COURSE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Want to learn how to be more effective in Logseq? My course "Logseq Mastery" is now available here 👉🏽 https://www.logseqmastery.com 🙌🏽 

If you're struggling to manage all your notes and information across personal, professional and academic life, then this is for you. I've built out a structured approach to mastering Logseq from the bottom-up, so that you don't need to navigate through a mass of disparate YouTube tutorials. 

Logseq is a powerful combination of a text editor, an outliner, and a linked-network builder, but there is admittedly a learning curve. The course has a wealth of write-ups, videos and diagrams to smooth your transition and quickly master the set of tools available to you in Logseq.

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=0)~~  this is the promise of xero inbox eluding you are your professional and personal organization systems a mess a thousand and one things screaming for your attention and no idea how to even start i've definitely felt like this before and i thought i knew about gtd or getting things done which is this book from david allen which comes highly recommended but then i read it at the beginning of last year and i realized that i actually didn't know a lot i've started to implement a lot of the ideas into my workflows and there's definitely been a considerable improvement in how i do things i don't think it's panacea the whole idea for me is to get to a mind like water where it just flows and there's clarity i'm not 100 there yet maybe i'll never be but i think i'm getting a bit ahead of myself in this video i'm just going to break down what is gtd how i actually think about productivity i think is an important part there too because i think you know it's very easy to get lost in this productivity space i'm going to speak 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=50)~~  about the core components of gtd and break them out into a bit more detail and then just some concluding remarks built on some of my experiences with gtd and some of the things that are lacking in the next video i'm going to speak about how you can implement some of these ideas in log seek so let's get into my database before getting into the content a quick word of thanks to everyone who supported the channel by watching sharing or contributing financially if you'd like to support financially my course log seek mastery is now available you can also support that coffee with small donations or monthly donations or decide to buy me a coffee or patron although note the fees there all of these links and some additional affiliate links are available at my link tree in the description below so what is getting things done and how does it help us achieve this mind like water getting things done is a productivity book slash methodology popularized by david allen and it's become a cornerstone book for knowledge workers just in the way that 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=102)~~  it breaks down setting up your work so that you can effectively do things and keep track of all your open loops it talks about five clear steps that apply order to chaos the first step is capture so collect what has your attention what are all the things that are open loops in your brain i mean it could be your mom's birthday that you have to get things for something for work so many open loops going on all at the same time make sure that you capture that into the system the next is clarify and what that means is to process what it means for you think about the totality of completing it and then the next step is organize put that thing where it belongs so making sure that you're putting in the right files that you can go and find it later no you're not just like leaving in your downloads folder the fourth thing is reflect and that just means going back to those places where you've stored your information or your reminders and your to-do's and making sure that you're processing them so that you don't have these open loops in your brain that will 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=155)~~  then be causing psychic drag and then step number five is engage simply just do the task what i'm going to try and do is distill down the things that are most important for me in gtd it's helpful to start with a disclaimer on my thoughts on productivity i'm really cautious with the productivity mindset and prefer to frame it differently for me the goal of any productivity techniques is not to do more and achieve more i think that's like you can never get off the treadmill you will just be the rat who is running running running for the cheese for me the goal is to get to a place of mind like water where i know that everything is under control and that i can stop worrying and my brain is not going off on random tangents thinking oh dear i have to go do this and something which is useful here is this quote which comes from the book gtd negative feelings from work come from breaking trust with yourself not from having too much to do and that is saying to yourself i need to do this and then not actually get into it david allen's approach and 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=215)~~  recommendation is all about being able to renegotiate the arrangements that you have with yourself so that you're not breaking trust of yourself and in essence disappointing your executive person upstairs who is not your boss but you it's like how can you manage everything so that you know that you're under control and that you are keeping your unwritten promises to yourself productivity is the art of channeling and rather removing obstacles and removing this psychic drag so it's about clearing up your mental ram so that you can work on the big picture it's all about being able to focus at the right level at the right time and i'm sure you've probably realized or been exposed to toxic productivity people with you know clickbaity titles 10x 5x whatever that stuff can drive you up the wall so what i've done if that is getting to you is i've included a soundcloud meditation in the links below it was a great meditation for me at like a key point last year when things were you know going pretty rough and this really helped me just to like relax and 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=274)~~  find a little bit of calm in the storm now i feel like for every video i make i could make a whole bunch of caveats there's so much else out there there's so much that is not being said but anyways i'm just trying my best here so this video assumes a basic knowledge of log seek first of all and then it's also important to clarify that there's no perfect way of doing this it's just the way that it works for you and one thing that i said before in the course is that software is not the solution it's rather your approach that is the solution and you need to customize that approach so that you can use it effectively because your brain works differently to my brain take the principles and apply them anywhere there's a lot of people who like just finding a template and seeing if they can make it work for them that's 100 okay i am not one of those people i love configuring things like to the nth degree so that it works for me and if by some miracle malware extrapolates perfectly to your way i'd be super happy for that another thing is that you can 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=330)~~  do gtd in any software i mean airtable asana trello notion monday.com whatever it's all just a matter of configuring your approach and how you are actually going to implement these principles as as always so many of these things are easier said than done i'm definitely not someone who's got everything right and has got it all figured out in this gcd space in fact i don't speak very much about the reflect part because i don't have like a proper weekly review that i'm sticking to and that's one of the biggest parts of gtd actually but i would be a hypocrite if i was telling you oh you have to do it like this i want to get better at it and this is one of the things that i'm working on a lot this year but at the moment i'm still not there so this is also just the start of this whole gtd workflow there's a lot of automation stash friction removal that can still happen i'm working on a lot of different things and i still think there's like a little bit of room for improvement but for me this seems to be working quite nicely and so now 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=384)~~  closing up these points let's get into gtd's core components ada's core david allen says that gtd is all about managing lists now this is why logsy actually works well with gtd but we'll get into that a little bit later because it's using the block based system with different tags the first thing that you need to do and it was in that workflow earlier is capture all your open loops and that is clearing your mind of all the things that you need to do now in the book he talks about like a whole approach for going and doing that and he really encourages you to invest a lot of time in this upfront like taking days so this is not a quick fix solution it's not going to make you more productive now you really have to invest the time there this is a quote from the book a complete and current projects list is the best way to move from tree hugging to forest management now what does he mean by tree hugging thinking at too granular level and losing the forest for the trees so that's when you are stuck in the details and not able to 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=445)~~  elevate yourself at a strategic level to think about the right questions for your company or even to manage your own tasks so it's all about just being able to zoom out and just like leave the detail where it is this expression like get out of the weeds and i definitely used to be in the weeds a lot and i think the best thing that one can do is just like slow down and zoom out take the pressure off allow yourself to think a little bit and being able to capture all these open loops helps you to get your head out of the weeds now how do you do this well it's all about having an effective capture technique so a typical workflow would be creating an inbox and then allocating tasks to those different inboxes now if you can imagine in the old days when you had those like paper stacks when you're on your desk that would be your inbox now how can you do that in a digital realm and we'll get into how you can do this in log seek but that's thinking about that inbox you know having a visual reminder of all the things that you need to do the next 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=499)~~  thing is clarifying your thinking and one of the first things to think about there is labeling items appropriately is it a project or is it a task now what are projects and what are tasks a project is a multi-step thing basically it's made up of multiple discrete components or different steps in order to build it up to the highest level of a project a task is a single action to complete in order to complete a project or to maintain an area now where did this aerial thing come from suddenly for those of you who might be familiar with the para methodology in tiago forte's methods tiago speaks about you achieve projects and maintain areas and in business sense i like to think of this as like business as usual as an area and projects is like some new innovation that you're rolling out in your company so that's the way that i think about projects versus areas that's getting a bit off tangent the next thing in gtd terms which is super important is identifying your next actions and this idea of identifying your next actions is 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=562)~~  really powerful if you leave a meeting or any engagement that you have with your team and you're not sure of what you have to do next that gives you you know clutching and straws thinking i have to maybe go do this it leaves that doubt and if you can identify your next actions and write those things down like everyone is 100 clear of what is required from them another tip that i've seen is making sure that your lists aren't fuzzy so don't just put like an army like a project or mom or whatever like you need to make it actionable and competable so when you return to it you don't get confused with why you put this thing there as a placeholder like it's not gonna do its function most importantly i think is making sure that your projects have clear outcomes like make sure that you're working to a defined goal and if you have that written somewhere it's nice to be able to refer back and see like what are we actually trying to achieve and also keep people in line particularly senior leadership when they go off and decide they actually want to 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=615)~~  do something else like no no but this is our objective so if you clarify your thinking the first time whenever you come back to that point it'll be very easy to see to like find your point of departure for that project again because you've already written out what is the requirement there another thing here which is tangentially related is that a large problem with people's management systems is they blend in a few actionable items with a massive unactionable things that although have value have no place so when these things aren't managed it gets a bit messy i don't know if that's from the book over something that i wrote because i don't know if it would write it gets a bit messy in the book but anyways clarify things if they actionable make sure they like in some way that you're going to come and find them later if they're not actionable put them in the right place another thing which i like to think about when i'm putting things into my logseek database specifically is think of it like you're talking to your future self because your 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=662)~~  future self is going to thank you when you specified more detail than you believe is now necessary i think we underestimate the importance of context and like just how much you're actually thinking about in the moment it's also important to clarify that there shouldn't be anxiety provoking david allen's whole approach is seeing things as they are rather than as they should be i think those shoulds are really what make us feel guilty and again that is one of those things that you are breaking trust with yourself if you don't do those things those should things organize that's just putting things where they belong is there a physical folder maybe a digital folder does something have to go into your calendar is there a reference folder that you'll be able to go to later when you need that thing for the project does it need to go in trash put it in trash clear your downloads folder the reflection step it's all about keeping track of your open loops so you need to commit to a weekly review which i'm guilty of not doing and that's something 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=720)~~  which i'm looking to to be better at in the future but basically the whole idea with this reflection is that you need to trust your system to be able to go and find the information you need much later down the line is really really valuable i think my databases have been built up over the course of you know 18 months now from rome and logseek and i'm i'm finding things that i didn't actually tag properly and that is you know indicating like breaks of trust but recently things have been properly tagged but yeah you really need to trust your database to return the information that you need when you need it and there's the reflect bullet points that i was just speaking to so you can have a look there on screen and then engage obviously just go and do the work you know execute not like a robot in a machine but in a joyful way so now we're going back into powerpoint something which i haven't done in a long time but i'm going to show you one of the flowcharts that is really popular in the gtd framework and this is the idea 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=775)~~  of stuff getting done now i don't actually like this top to bottom approach so i'm gonna do something a little bit different although this is there for you for reference i'm going to look at it from this workflow perspective so the first part in our funnel as we've spoken about is capture the next part is clarify and then the third part is organize as you can see i've left out the reflect and engaged because engage is doing the work and doing the weekly review is not something which i'm actively doing but anyways getting into it the capture workflow let's look at all the things that might come here you know you get emails ideas files sources meeting notes a whole bunch of inputs and these are coming at you throughout the day now the next step here is to clarify what is the next action or maybe there's no action required but let's start with what is the next action workflow and then go on from there is it actionable in less than two minutes if it is the theory is do it now if it's not actionable in less than two minutes it 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=838)~~  needs to go through a step of other two things you need to defer it or you need to delegate it now if you're deferring it you can put it in your calendar to do it at a specific time or you can put it in some next actions task manager and the idea there is to do it asap i'll make a point on this now when i just speak about prioritization if you delegate it what you want to do is add some sort of marker that illustrates that you are waiting for that task to come back from whoever you delegated it to now what if there's no action required so if there's no action required maybe you need to put into reference so that there's easy retrieval when you need it or maybe that's some sort of archive maybe you need to put it into a someday maybe list and this is also things that you can review later down the line or maybe these are your reminders and then the final thing that you can do is you can put in trash some things which i want to add just at the end of this video that i think are very important to clarify within this gtd 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=896)~~  approach and the first thing there is that gtd does not talk about prioritization funnily enough it talks about just having your stacks well managed and then going and doing those tasks as soon as you can now i think this is a bit of a shortcoming of the methodology but it also bears reminding that everyone has their own different methods for prioritization one person that i could point to is kehi he has a nice framework which is doing 10k work so you got 10 work you've got 100 work a thousand dollar work and 10 000 work and that's all about identifying like what are your big ticket items the stuff that doesn't give you the dopamine hit but you know needs to get done in order to you know really move the needle long term so a little bit to be desired in the prioritization space but go check out ke something that really resonates for me is that the most important thing that you can do is have a complete and comprehensive list of things to work on so that you have clarified your thinking and you're not having to rethink or redo the work when 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=957)~~  you get back to picking up that task there's a nice part in the book where he says you're other planning work you're doing planned work or you're doing adult work now which one of those do you want to maximize i think you want to maximize doing planned work rather than doing ad hoc work you like really want to try and minimize that ad hoc work and you know in a business it's very difficult to you know suddenly squash that ad hoc work but sort out your systems and processes will definitely help with that but it is a good idea to choose your work and be able to track it and learn from your processes something super random now learning how to type so he mentions this in the book it's like one of those things which you don't think about but like we spend so much time typing and it can really be a game changer like moving from a pick and hunt and and then getting to space where you touch typing now i worked on this at the beginning of last year and it was really difficult i was typing like 35 or like 40 words per minute like you know i was like that's 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=1019)~~  okay and then i started practicing touch typing i plummeted i was like doing like 29 or 30 words per minute but now after a year of practice um so i don't even know if this belongs in the video but these are some of the tutorials that i use to get up to speed and hopefully they can be helpful for you too it's just one of these quick ones it's like using keyboard shortcuts they can help so much it sounds a bit trivial when you like first look at it but actually when you start using keyboard shortcuts it unlocks a lot of speed for you but again speed is not the objective being able to do things effectively is subjective if you want to read the book i can highly recommend it it's really a good book if you want you can also check out the book summary on short form for those of you who haven't been exposed to short form short form is a book summary service i am an affiliate of short form they're not sponsoring this video i like the service because i use the book summaries once i've read the book to help me backtrack and find the information that 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=1070)~~  i might need without having to go through the whole book again i can also download the pdf and put that into my database which is really useful for my own workflow so they've got really good book summaries and this one here on getting things done is particularly good and you can go in and download the pdf and then add it to your lockseek database that's how i do it nothing really replaces reading the book but this really augments your experience of reading the book and i've got lots of books that i'm going back to the notes here instead of having to reread the books thanks again for watching i will see you in the next video hopefully for how to implement gcd and logseek as i said it's all about managing lists and log 6 block based approach really allows you to pull the different blocks into the lists that you need so very useful from that

Я начал внедрять многие идеи в свою  рабочие процессы, и определенно произошло значительное улучшение в том, как я что-то делаю, я не думаю, что это панацея, вся идея для меня состоит в том, чтобы добраться до ума, подобного воде, где он просто течет и есть ясность, мне еще не 100, может быть, я  никогда не буду, но я думаю, что в этом видео я немного забегаю вперед. Я просто собираюсь рассказать, что такое gtd, как я на самом деле думаю о продуктивности, я думаю, что это тоже важная часть, потому что я думаю, вы знаете, что это очень  легко заблудиться в этой области производительности. Я собираюсь поговорить 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=50)~~  об основных компонентах gtd и разобрать их более подробно, а затем просто несколько заключительных замечаний, основанных на моем опыте работы с gtd и некоторых вещах, которые  чего не хватает в следующем видео, я собираюсь рассказать о том, как вы можете реализовать некоторые из этих идей в поиске по журналам, так что давайте зайдем в мою базу данных, прежде чем переходить к контенту, небольшое спасибо всем, кто поддержал канал, посмотрев, поделившись или внося свой вклад.  финансово, если вы хотите поддержать финансово, мой журнал курсов, поиск мастерства теперь доступен, вы также можете поддержать этот кофе небольшими пожертвованиями или ежемесячными пожертвованиями или решить купить мне кофе или покровителя, хотя обратите внимание на плату за все эти ссылки и некоторые дополнительные  партнерские ссылки доступны в моем дереве ссылок в описании ниже, так что же помогает нам достичь цели и как это помогает нам достичь этого разума, как вода. Доведение дел до конца — это методология продуктивности, популяризированная Дэвидом Алленом,

Я очень осторожен с мышлением производительности и предпочитаю формулировать его по-другому. Для меня цель любых методов повышения производительности - не делать больше  и добиться большего, я думаю, это похоже на то, что ты никогда не сможешь сойти с беговой дорожки, ты будешь просто крысой, которая бегает за сыром, для меня цель - добраться до такого состояния ума, как вода, где я знаю, что все под контролем  и что я могу перестать беспокоиться, и мой мозг не отвлекается на случайные мысли, думая о боже, мне нужно пойти и сделать это, и кое-что полезное, вот эта цитата, которая взята 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=201)~~  из книги, gtd негативные чувства от работы возникают из-за потери доверия к себе  не из-за того, что нужно сделать слишком много, и это значит сказать себе, что мне нужно сделать это, а потом не вдаваться в это. Подход и рекомендации Дэвида Аллена заключаются в том, чтобы иметь возможность пересмотреть договоренности, которые у вас есть с самим собой, чтобы вы не подрывать доверие к себе и, по сути, разочаровывать своего руководителя наверху, который является не вашим начальником, а вами, это похоже на то, как можно все успеть так, чтобы вы знали, что вы под контролем и что вы выполняете свои неписаные обещания, данные себе, продуктивность - это искусство  о направлении и, скорее, устранении препятствий и устранении этого психического сопротивления, так что речь идет о прояснении вашего умственного барана, чтобы вы могли работать над общей картиной, все дело в способности сосредоточиться на правильном уровне в нужное время, и я уверен, что вы  Я, вероятно, осознавал или подвергался токсичной продуктивности.

Ядро ada Дэвид Аллен говорит, что теперь gtd - это управление списками, поэтому logsy на самом деле хорошо работает с gtd, но мы  Я вернусь к этому чуть позже, потому что здесь используется блочная система с различными тегами. Первое, что вам нужно сделать, и это было в этом рабочем процессе ранее, — это захватить все ваши открытые циклы, и это очистит ваш разум от всего, что  вам нужно сделать сейчас, в книге, о которой он говорит, как о целостном подходе к тому, чтобы пойти и сделать это, и он действительно призывает вас потратить много

Проект — это многоэтапная вещь, в основном он состоит из множества отдельных компонентов или различных шагов, чтобы довести его до самого высокого уровня.  проекта задача — это одно действие, которое необходимо выполнить, чтобы

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=578)~~  все на 100 ясно понимают, что от них требуется еще один совет, который я видел: убедитесь, что ваши списки не размыты, поэтому не создавайте их просто как армия, например, проект или мама или что-то еще, что вам нужно, чтобы сделать их действенными и конкурентоспособными, поэтому, когда вы вернетесь  для этого вы не запутаетесь, почему вы поместили эту вещь здесь в качестве заполнителя, как будто она не будет выполнять свою функцию. Самое главное, я думаю, это убедиться, что ваши проекты имеют четкие результаты, например, убедитесь, что вы работаете над определенной целью и если у вас где-то это записано, было бы приятно иметь возможность вернуться назад и посмотреть, чего мы на самом деле пытаемся достичь, а также держать людей в узде, особенно высшее руководство, когда они уходят и решают, что на самом деле хотят сделать что-то еще, например нет нет  но это наша цель, поэтому, если вы проясните свое мышление в первый раз, когда бы вы ни вернулись к этой точке, вам будет очень легко снова найти отправную точку для этого проекта, потому что 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=625)~~  вы уже написали, в чем состоит Требование здесь еще одна вещь, которая косвенно связана с этим, заключается в том, что большая проблема с системами управления людьми заключается в том, что они смешивают несколько элементов, требующих действий, с огромным количеством вещей, не требующих действий, которые, хотя и имеют ценность, но не имеют места, поэтому, когда этими вещами не управляют, это становится немного  беспорядочно, я не знаю, из книги ли это вместо того, что я написал, потому что я не знаю, будет ли это написано, в книге получается немного беспорядочно, но в любом случае проясните вещи, если они действенны, убедитесь, что им нравится то, что вам нравится  Я собираюсь прийти и найти их позже, если они не приведут к действию, поместите их в нужное место. Еще одна вещь, о которой мне нравится думать, когда я помещаю что-то в свою базу данных logseek, - это думать об этом так, как будто вы разговариваете с  ваше будущее «я», потому что ваше будущее «я» будет вам благодарно, если вы укажете больше деталей, чем вы

Я думаю, что мы недооцениваем важность контекста, и, например, то, о чем вы на самом деле думаете в данный момент, также важно уточнить.  что не должно быть беспокойства, провоцирующего беспокойство. Весь подход Дэвида Аллена заключается в том, чтобы видеть вещи такими, какие они есть, а не такими, какими они должны быть. Я думаю, что именно эти «должны» действительно заставляют нас чувствовать себя виноватыми, и опять же, это одна из тех вещей, из-за которых вы нарушаете доверие к себе  если вы не делаете этих вещей, то следует все организовать, то есть просто расставить вещи по своим местам, есть ли физическая папка, может быть, цифровая папка что-то делает в вашем календаре, есть ли справочная папка, к которой вы сможете перейти  позже, когда вам понадобится эта вещь для проекта, нужно ли ее отправлять в корзину, поместите ее в корзину, очистите папку загрузок, этап размышления, все дело в отслеживании ваших открытых циклов, поэтому вам нужно взять на себя обязательства по еженедельному обзору, в чем я

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=772)~~  рамках gtd, и это идея того, что нужно делать сейчас. Мне на самом деле не нравится этот подход сверху вниз, поэтому я собираюсь сделать что-то немного другое, хотя это  Это для справки, я собираюсь взглянуть на это с точки зрения рабочего процесса, поэтому первая часть нашей воронки, о которой мы говорили, — это захват, следующая часть — уточнение, а затем третья часть — организация, как вы можете видеть, я  Я пропустил размышление и занялся, потому что участие выполняет работу, а еженедельный обзор - это не то, чем я активно занимаюсь, но в любом случае приступаю к рабочему процессу захвата, давайте посмотрим на все, что может произойти здесь, вы знаете, что получаете  электронные письма, идеи, файлы, источники, заметки о встречах, целая куча входных данных, и они поступают к вам в течение дня, теперь следующий шаг — уточнить, какое следующее действие, или, возможно, никаких действий не требуется, но давайте начнем с того, каков рабочий процесс следующего действия и затем продолжайте дальше, можно ли выполнить действие менее чем за две

Теперь я думаю, что это небольшой недостаток методологии, но это  Также стоит напомнить, что у каждого свои методы расстановки приоритетов. Один человек, на которого я мог бы указать, — это Кехи, у него есть хорошая структура, которая выполняет 10 тысяч работ, поэтому у вас есть 10 работ, у вас есть 100 работ, работа на тысячу долларов и 10 000 работ.  и это все о том, чтобы определить, какие для вас важные вещи, вещи, которые не дают вам выброса дофамина, но вы знаете, что нужно сделать, чтобы вы знали, действительно сдвиньте иглу в долгосрочной перспективе, так что 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorYPmO0Gak&t=940)~~  немного желать лучшего в место для расстановки приоритетов, но посмотрите, что меня действительно резонирует, так это то, что самое важное, что вы можете сделать, это иметь полный и исчерпывающий список дел, над которыми вам нужно работать, чтобы вы прояснили свое мышление и вам не пришлось переосмысливать  или переделай работу, когда вернешься к выполнению этой задачи, в книге есть приятный момент, где он говорит, что ты занимаешься другой работой по планированию, ты выполняешь запланированную работу, или ты сейчас выполняешь работу для взрослых, какую из них ты хочешь  чтобы максимизировать, я думаю, вы хотите максимизировать выполнение запланированной работы, а не выполнять разовую работу, которая вам нравится, действительно хотите попытаться свести к минимуму эту разовую работу, и вы знаете, что в бизнесе очень сложно внезапно раздавить эту разовую работу, но разобраться в ней  ваши системы и процессы определенно помогут в этом, но было бы хорошей идеей выбрать свою работу, иметь возможность отслеживать ее и учиться на своих

Я являюсь партнером короткой формы. Они не спонсируют это видео. Мне нравится эта услуга, потому что я использую краткое изложение книги после прочтения книги, чтобы помочь мне вернуться назад и найти информацию, которая может мне понадобиться, без необходимости просматривать ее.  всю книгу еще раз, я также могу скачать PDF-файл и поместить его в свою базу данных, что очень полезно для моего рабочего процесса, так что у них есть действительно хорошие аннотации к книгам, а вот этот, посвященный выполнению задач, особенно хорош, и вы можете войти и  загрузите PDF-файл, а затем

Надеюсь, увидимся в следующем видео о том, как реализовать gcd и logseek, поскольку я уже сказал, что все дело в управлении списками, а подход на основе блоков log 6 действительно позволяет вам объединять различные блоки в  списки, которые вам нужны, очень полезны с этой
