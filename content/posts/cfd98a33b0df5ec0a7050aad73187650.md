Overview: 
The key to good and efficient creating (writing, videos or other content) lies in the intelligent organization of ideas and notes.

This book helps people from all backgrounds get more done, write intelligent texts and learn for the long run. It teaches you how to take smart notes and ensure they bring you and your projects forward.

The principles draw from a tried and tested note-taking-technique. Not only does this book explain how it works, but also why.

Instead of wasting your time searching for notes, quotes or references, you can focus on what really counts: thinking, understanding and developing new ideas in writing.

The system is based off the legendary "Zettlekasten" methodology developed by Niklas Luhmann, a 20th century Sociologist who published a prodigious amount of work: 70 books and more than 400 articles before his death.

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=0)~~  i've used the ideas from this book to create a mental model a framework a latticework a web of over 100 different book notes and a thousand different ideas i've created book notes on things like habits i've created book notes on things like learning and focus all of which we're going to be talking a lot about here today but the reason i've done this is because i believe the reason to good and efficient creating writing creating videos or other content lies in the intelligent organization of ideas and notes and this book is going to help people from all different backgrounds to get more done to write intelligently to think about their learning for the long run it's going to teach us how to take smart notes and ensure that they bring you and your projects forward the principles here are tried and tested and they're a note-taking technique not only does this book explain how it's going to work but also why instead of wasting your time searching for notes for quotes and for references you can focus on what really counts 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=64)~~  which is thinking understanding and developing new ideas in your writing this system inside of how to take smart notes is based off the legendary zedelkaston method developed by nicholas lumen who was a 20th century sociologist who also published a prestigious amount of work 70 books and more than 400 articles before his death you can see that today we're talking a little bit about habits we're talking a little bit about goals we're talking a little bit about learning here today and talking about focus as well getting a little bit more granular the first idea that i pulled out of the book of the six is preparation not iq and to sum it up the quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made the decision on the topic but if that's true and i wholeheartedly believe it is in the key to successful writing lies in the preparation it also means that the vast majority of self-help books and study guides can only help you to close the barn door 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=127)~~  correctly and according to the official rules not just a moment but many months after the horse has already escaped with that in mind it's not surprising that the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people's heads but in the way that they do their everyday work in fact there is no measurable correlation between a high iq and academic success at least not north of 120 yes a certain intellectual capacity helps you get into academia and if you struggle severely with an iq test it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems too but once you're in a superior iq will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure my reflection here is that the perfect example of fixed versus growth mindset and how that hinders our ability in everyday life of course this book also speaks mostly about academia which is not something i'm familiar with but nowadays a lot of us are knowledge workers and responsible for creating work what i recommend here is to check out 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=190)~~  mindset by carol dweck for just more information on fixed versus growth mindset i think it's definitely worth checking out and i've got a whole entire mind map on it that i'll link for you down below the too long didn't read to the very beginning of how to take smart notes it's just knowing that iq which is something predetermined for the most part is not the major factor in determining our success even when knowledge and learning is a key component of what it is we do so what is the key component well people like angela duckworth and martin seligman did some research and they said self-discipline and self-control is what really is going to be the thing that dictates whether you're going to be successful or not in many different ways now i've also done book summaries on duckworth and seligman so if you're interested go and check those out but that's something you can check out at a later date something that might sound even scarier but you know the this like self-discipline and things like that might sound like oh i wish i 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=250)~~  could just rely on my iq but truly this just means that everything else we've learned on this channel things like how to set good habits how to set goals how to have a little bit of discipline those are all going to play a key part in our success as well as having a good system for taking notes which is something we're going to talk about and i think that's very empowering it's not something fixed but it's something that you can actually have an influence on that's going to dictate your success next we're looking into nicholas lumen and one quote that he has inside the book i never force myself to do anything i don't feel like whenever i am stuck i do something else which i think is something great to aim for we also think about in 30 years he published 58 books and hundreds of articles translations not included many of them became classics in their respective fields even after his death about a half dozen more books on diverse subjects like religion education politics were published in his name based on almost finished 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=309)~~  manuscripts lying around his office there are many more than a few colleagues that i know who would give a lot less to be half as productive in their whole lifetime as lumen was after his death a good structure allows you to do that to move seamlessly from one task to another without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture writing is not a linear process and we constantly have to jump back and forth between tasks it wouldn't make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level but he collected his notes in a slip box in such a way that his collection became more and more than the sum of his parts his slip box became his dialogue partner main idea generator and productivity engine it helped him to structure and develop his thoughts and it was fun to work with because it worked so that's the story of nicholas lumen one of the pro most prolific academics in modern history but really it's less about lumen and how much of a genius he is and is really about the system that he's created and is using 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=372)~~  or has used sorry to be so prolific it's kind of like if he can do it so can i story more than anything else the main ideas here for me are that writing is not a linear process if you're bored or not interested in something you won't do your best work and it doesn't mean that you should stop altogether just find something that you are interested in and i think that's why this map is so great for me if i want to learn about something in particular of course i can dive in and look into that topic like if i wanted to learn just about habits i could pull this out i could learn a little bit more about focus i could learn a little bit more about habits whatever one i decided to grab on that day but if focus or habits are boring me or there's no good books in that area that i want to think about i've got all of these different ones that i could click and kind of choose my own adventure to find different things specifically with someone with a little bit of adhd this is a really good way to do it by collecting notes creating collections 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=427)~~  we can create something much larger than just a collection of our notes so for example i've been doing a question and answer period there's a form down below if you want to fill out a question i'd be happy to make a video for you answering your question and what i do is i lay this out i've got all of these thoughts all of these ideas and what i do is i put your question to the system i go out there and i find the answers that i think most reflect what would be helpful for you in your situation so i definitely think it's worth you going out and either checking out those videos that i'll do on the channel or also submitting your own question potentially i'll be the one answering the question for you so our next idea here is just about the slip box manual how do you use the slip box of nicholas lumen strictly speaking lumen has two different slip boxes he's got a biographical one bibliographical one which contains the references and brief notes on the content of the literature and the main one in which he collected and generated his 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=487)~~  ideas mainly in response to what he read the notes were written on index cards and stored in wooden boxes and whenever he read something he would write bibliographic information on one side of the card and make brief notes about the content on the other side these notes would end up in the bibliographic slip box in a second step shortly after he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing he would then turn to the main slip box and write his ideas comments and thoughts on a new piece of paper using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box he kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single sheet but sometimes you would add another note to extend a thought so the idea of the slip box here for me is really revolutionary often we try and take notes in a singular context and think that it's going to be helpful for us to remember something but we can 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=548)~~  think of this process like the mind maps i'd done before each one was great on their own but they really had no connection to the other mind maps meaning it was a good exercise to try and remember something for me but just not all that useful to all of us when we're trying to create something useful out of the content now with the slip box method which i'm using obsidian for this is that i this is the tool that i'm using i take all of these notes in the same place they can be connected and drawn from at any point in time in the future without much friction there's also something to be said i think for two different types of note taking bibliographic is like taking quotes and authors that i highlight from the books these are easy and quick to take down and there's something that you can do as you're reading and not interrupt your workflow the next piece is like reflections or putting things into your own words and this is something that they talk a lot about inside of make it stick i recommend you go and check out that book 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=605)~~  if you haven't already looked at it they talk about how putting something in your own words is a really powerful memory tool but now coming from how to take smart notes it also gives us this chance to think about how the work fits into our greater view of the entire system and of course this is absolutely what we're trying to do with our map as well it's just okay what are the main ideas of learning what are the main ideas of potentially habits or different things like focus and things that i want to know what are the main ideas and what's connected to it so i want to create my view of the world and i'm doing that through these content maps which are the light blue nodes as well so the next piece we're talking about is just the process of taking smart notes probably this is a big piece of what we're thinking about here so the process is really five different steps the first one is to make fleeting notes always have something at hand to write with capture every idea that pops into your mind don't worry too much about how you 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=664)~~  write it down or what you write it on these are fleeting notes mere reminders of what's in your head they should not cause any distraction put them on one place and which define as kind of your inbox and process them later the next is to make literature notes so whenever you're reading something make notes about the content write down what you don't want to forget and think about what you might use in your own thinking or writing you want to keep it very short be extremely selective and use your own words number three is to make permanent notes now turn to your slip box of course go through your notes that you made in step number one and two ideally once a day before you forget what it meant and think about how they relate to what is relevant for you and your own research thinking and interests step number four is to add your permanent notes to the slip box by filling each one behind filing each one behind the other one and etc we won't go over that too much because everyone's going to be using their own tools but number five is just to develop your 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=726)~~  own topics the questions the research and think about it from bottoms up from within the system see what's there what is missing and what questions arise so this is actually a tool that i've created as well this quote really kind of just speaks for itself no matter what tool you're using it's the process of taking smart notes but let me explain how i do it a little bit in each one of these steps step number one is to make fleeting notes of course and this for me looks like reading or listening to a book and highlighting the important points from the book that i think would make it into my summary this is great because it has the ability to store it inside of the cloud as well and it really limits the friction that goes on step number two for me is the ebook reader actually allows me to take small notes with each highlight as well and i use that section to make any connections to the previous ideas that i would want to remember when i move into step number three step number three is when i copy the highlights into obsidian 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=784)~~  and i add my own reflections in i organize them i try to do six to eight points per book step number four is luckily i can do steps number three and four together with obsidian as it has a really great interlinking system which is the map in the graph that you're seeing right here i just linked one page to another and i can easily see it inside of the graph and move around as i see fit step number five is to moving more towards now so instead of just book summaries i'm going to be trying to bring full topics and answering questions and forming my own arguments via the notes i've already created actually a quick plug for that how i read and summarized 100 different books is my very first kind of exploration note i'm going to call them so that's something that you can check out on the channel as well coming up so our next idea here is just the tools for taking smart notes so there are really four different things we want to keep in mind for taking smart notes getting the tools ready shouldn't take any more than five to ten minutes and 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=845)~~  ideally it's built right in as it is with my system but having the right tools is one part of the equation it is easy to get fooled by their simplicity many have tried them out with out really understanding how to work them and were expectedly disappointed with the results tools are only as good as your ability to work with them and i could say that it took me quite a long time to figure out exactly how i wanted to get obsidian to work for me you need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head wherever you use whatever you use it should not require any thoughts attention or multiple steps to write it down the system the reference system has two different purposes to collect references and the notes that you take during your reading the slip box some prefer old-fashioned pen and paper version to a wooden box and that's fine but computers really can speed up a relatively minor part of the work in the equation anyways things like adding links and formatting the references of course the thinking 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=907)~~  and the creating is the hardest part here finally the editor and we won't talk too much about that but luckily obsidian does both not a huge plug for obsidian but it is a cool tool there isn't that much that you truly need to take smart notes the paper notebook and flashcard might be the best option for you which is great i would say however there are a few tools that i personally like to use for each of these steps the first step i use two different tools first i use an audio book player and i know that's blasphemy to some of us out there but this allows me to take in information at any time on the go which is great for me however it's not great at creating notes or capturing thoughts so i actually also have an ebook version that i use to highlight and take notes in at the same time on the same device whether i'm using my phone or an ipad or something like that step number two the ebook reader i use usually has the option to pull up my highlights and notes all in one section so i pull that up and i use that as my permanent reference guide when i'm 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=968)~~  coming into step number three which is the tool that we're in right now and it's essentially my slip box obsidian it's amazing way to capture both references and reflections as well as organize my notes in a way that makes sense to me step number four is obsidian really covers this step as well without much need to think about it it's using a markdown editor which may take some time to learn if you're not familiar but it's really a friction free way to write and to format so definitely recommend checking out that process the next idea and the final idea actually is to think inside the box creativity cannot be taught like a rule or an approach to a plan but we can make sure that our working environment allows us to be creative with ideas it also helps to kind of keep the mind helps to keep in mind some creativity creativity inducing ideas about problem solving that might be counterintuitive it is worth it to dwell on this subject a little bit before you move on to the next step the preparation of the rough draft of the manuscript 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=1038)~~  the real enemy of independent thinking is not external authority but our own inertia the ability to generate new ideas has more to do with breaking old habits of thinking than coming up with as many new ideas as possible for obvious reasons i do not recommend thinking outside the box on the contrary here we can turn the slip box into a tool for breaking out our own thinking habits our brains just love routines before new information prompts our brains to think differently about something they may take the new information to fit into the known or let it disappear completely from our perception usually we don't even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to make it fit its expectations we need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinking in routines so my reflection on this is that thinking in routines is the way that our minds are set up because we've got billions of bits of data coming at us every single day this is great of course because it means we're not stapled to the couch thinking about how weird it is that the 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=1101)~~  entire universe is you know constantly right above us right we're floating on this convertible which is really weird but as far as coming up with truly creative work not so good for that well it's different because your brain is completely on autopilot so sake points out here an inversion on a common phrase might be the best way to go and also i recommend you go and check out inversion that's coming from the the book by shane parish the great mental models volume number one talks all about inversion and how you can use that to spur new ideas so in here thinking outside the box is worse than thinking inside the box so now we've got all these ideas these references these notes and it's the process of taking those notes making the references and doing your reflections but then letting the box come up with the ideas the connections in the path for your writing and creative work for me now to create a video all i need is a spark of idea which for me there isn't any shortage of while i'm reading and then i can find multiple connections 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=1167)~~  even if they seem completely unconnected and create a completely new video in under an hour that's the true power of taking smart notes so those are the six big ideas preparation not iq nicholas lumen we've got the slip box manual got the process of taking smart notes the tools for taking smart notes and think inside the box now we're going to go into a couple of different tools the first one is just the process of taking smart notes which we already have gone over but i also want to talk about something from jim quick called the faster model and then digital distraction breaking your addiction so that you can actually put into place any of these ideas so the faster model is number one so we've got the faster model here we've got the acronym standing for forget act state teach enter review so i really like this model and the whole idea is essentially what you need to do here is follow this faster model and i won't go over each and every single piece but the way i used to do this is before each mind map and while reading i do two things you 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=1233)~~  gotta turn off your phone and forget all the distractions while i'm mind mapping that's actually the process of learning or while i'm building these notes that's my process of learning for the state i always listen to music while i'm writing down my notes but as i'm reading i never listen to any music the next thing is teaching and of course that's what these videos are for next is entering so these videos are the perfect example of entering each week i'm committing to making one video so you want to enter something into your calendar and the next one is review so this is what the beauty of kind of how to take smart notes actually is for me it's essentially just saying okay you know i'm i'm making these notes but now i have a way to reference it now i have a way to come back and essentially relearn things right revisit things and that's extremely important as well so it's important to have a place in your notes where you can revisit and relearn things again and again the next tool that i wanted to talk about is digital distraction 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=1298)~~  and this is something of course that's coming from cal newport and you're more than welcome to join the join the channel and get these tools all for yourself but how do we break digital addiction really it comes in three different steps number one is set up some rules some example rules are don't have social media apps on your phone turn off your notification and set up site blockers on your work computer those are three good rules the next piece is find other things to do don't sit around and stare at a wall instead find things that you enjoy doing that don't involve technology number three is to schedule your usage of course if you're not going to step away 100 from using technology and break that digital addiction all together we want to make sure that we are scheduling time blocks where you are going to use social media intentionally so definitely worth checking out there i really recommend that you join the youtube channel get access to the tools get access to all of the different tools that we've created every single white dot here is a new

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=0)~~  Я использовал идеи из этой книги, чтобы создать ментальную модель, структуру, решетчатую структуру, сеть из более чем 100 различных заметок и тысячи разных идей. Я создал заметки о таких вещах, как привычки. Я создал заметки о таких вещах, как привычки.  учиться и концентрироваться, обо всем этом мы сегодня будем много говорить, но причина, по которой я это сделал, заключается в том, что я считаю, что причина хорошего и эффективного создания текстов, создания видео или другого контента заключается в разумной организации идей.  и заметки, и эта книга поможет людям с разным опытом делать больше, писать разумно, думать о своем обучении в долгосрочной перспективе. Она научит нас, как делать умные заметки и гарантировать, что они продвигают вас и ваши проекты вперед. принципы здесь опробованы и проверены, и это техника ведения заметок. В этой книге не только объясняется, как она будет работать, но и почему вместо того, чтобы тратить время на поиск заметок, цитат и ссылок, вы можете сосредоточиться на том, что действительно важно. 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=64)~~  что означает понимание и развитие новых идей в вашем письме. Эта система, позволяющая делать умные заметки, основана на легендарном методе зеделькастона, разработанном Николасом Люменом, социологом 20-го века, который также опубликовал престижное количество работ (70 и более книг).  400 статей до его смерти, вы можете видеть, что сегодня мы говорим немного о привычках, мы говорим немного о целях, мы сегодня немного говорим об обучении, а также говорим о концентрации, а также о том, чтобы получить немного больше.  детальная первая идея, которую я извлек из книги шести, — это подготовка, а не iq, и, подводя итог, качество статьи и легкость, с которой она написана, больше всего зависят от того, что вы сделали в письменной форме еще до того, как написали.  принял решение по этой теме, но если это правда, и я искренне верю, что ключ к успешному письму лежит в подготовке, это также означает, что подавляющее большинство книг по саморазвитию и учебных пособий могут только помочь вам закрыть дверь сарая правильно и по официальным правилам не через 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=130)~~  мгновение, а через много месяцев после того, как лошадь уже сбежала. Имея это в виду, неудивительно, что единственный и самый важный показатель академического успеха следует искать не в головах людей, а в том, как они  выполнять свою повседневную работу на самом деле нет измеримой корреляции между высоким IQ и академическими успехами, по крайней мере, не выше 120 да, определенные интеллектуальные способности помогают вам поступить в академические круги, и если у вас серьезные проблемы с тестом на IQ, вполне вероятно, что вы будете бороться  решать академические проблемы, но как только вы достигнете более высокого уровня IQ, это не поможет вам отличиться и не защитит вас от неудач. Я думаю, что это идеальный пример фиксированного мышления в противовес растущему мышлению и того, как это, конечно, мешает нашим способностям в повседневной жизни.  в этой книге также говорится в основном об академических кругах, с которыми я не знаком, но в настоящее время многие из нас являются работниками умственного труда и отвечают за создание 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=187)~~  работы. Я рекомендую здесь проверить мышление Кэрол Дуэк, чтобы получить просто больше информации о фиксированном и росте.  образ мышления, я думаю, что это определенно стоит проверить, и у меня есть целая карта разума, которую я свяжу для вас ниже, слишком долго не читал до самого начала, как делать умные заметки, просто знаю, что  IQ, который по большей части предопределен, по большей части предопределен, не является основным фактором, определяющим наш успех, даже когда знания и обучение являются ключевым компонентом того, что мы делаем, так что же является ключевым компонентом? Такие люди, как Анджела Дакворт и Мартин Селигман, провели небольшое исследование.  и они сказали, что самодисциплина и самоконтроль - это то, что на самом деле будет тем, что будет определять, добьетесь ли вы успеха или нет, во многих разных отношениях. Теперь я также написал аннотации к книгам о Дакворте и Селигмане, так что, если вы  вам интересно, идите и проверьте это, но это то, что вы можете проверить позже, что-то, что может звучать еще страшнее, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=245)~~  но вы знаете, это как самодисциплина и тому подобные вещи могут звучать так: «О, мне бы хотелось просто положиться на свою  iq, но на самом деле это просто означает, что все остальное, чему мы научились на этом канале, например, как выработать хорошие привычки, как ставить цели, как иметь немного дисциплины, все это сыграет ключевую роль в нашем успехе, а также  иметь хорошую систему для ведения заметок, о которой мы собираемся поговорить, и я думаю, что это очень расширяет возможности, это не что-то фиксированное, но это то, на что вы действительно можете повлиять, и это будет определять ваш успех в следующий раз, который мы рассмотрим Николас Люмен и одна цитата, которая есть у него в книге, я никогда не заставляю себя делать что-либо, мне не хочется, когда я застреваю, я делаю что-то еще, что, по моему мнению, является чем-то великим, к чему мы тоже думаем через 30 лет, он опубликовал  58 книг и сотни переводов статей, не включенных в список, многие из них стали классикой в ​​своих областях даже после его смерти, еще около полдюжины 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=302)~~  книг на различные темы, такие как политика религиозного образования, были опубликованы от его имени на основе почти готовых рукописей, валявшихся в его офисе. это гораздо больше, чем несколько моих знакомых коллег, которые отдали бы намного меньше, чтобы за всю свою жизнь быть вдвое менее продуктивными, чем был Люмен после его смерти. Хорошая структура позволяет вам делать это, чтобы плавно переходить от одной задачи к другой, не ставя под угрозу  вся аранжировка или упущение из виду более широкой картины написание не является линейным процессом, и нам постоянно приходится прыгать туда и обратно между задачами, было бы бессмысленно контролировать себя на микроуровне на этом уровне, но он собрал свои записи в ящик для бумаг в таком виде.  таким образом, что его коллекция становилась все больше и больше, чем просто сумма его частей, его ящик стал его партнером по диалогу, главным генератором идей и двигателем производительности, главным генератором идей и двигателем производительности, он помогал ему структурировать и развивать

Основные идеи здесь для меня заключаются в том, что написание текста - это не линейный процесс, если вам скучно или вы не заинтересованы в чем-то, вы не будете выполнять свою работу наилучшим образом, и это не так.  Это не значит, что вам следует вообще остановиться, просто найдите что-то, что вас интересует, и я думаю, именно поэтому эта карта так хороша для меня, если я хочу узнать о чем-то конкретном, конечно, я могу погрузиться и изучить эту тему, например, если  я хотел узнать только о привычках, я мог бы вытащить это, я мог бы узнать немного больше о концентрации, я мог бы узнать немного больше 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=407)~~  о привычках, какую бы я ни решил захватить в тот день, но если концентрация или привычки мне надоедают или нет  хорошие книги в этой области, о которых я хочу подумать. У меня есть все эти разные книги, на которые я могу нажать и выбрать свое собственное приключение, чтобы найти разные вещи, особенно с кем-то с небольшим количеством СДВГ, это действительно хороший способ  чтобы сделать это, собирая заметки, создавая коллекции, мы можем создать нечто гораздо большее, чем просто коллекция наших заметок, поэтому, например, я проводил период вопросов и ответов, внизу есть форма, если вы хотите заполнить вопрос, я бы  буду рад сделать видео для вас, отвечая на ваш вопрос, и что я делаю, так это излагаю это, у меня есть все эти мысли, все эти идеи, и что я делаю, так это задаю ваш вопрос системе, выхожу туда и  найдите ответы, которые, я думаю, больше всего отражают то, что было бы полезно для вас в вашей ситуации, поэтому я определенно думаю, что вам стоит пойти и посмотреть те видео, которые я буду делать на канале, или также задать свой собственный вопрос, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=461)~~  возможно, я  будьте тем, кто ответит на ваш вопрос, поэтому наша следующая идея здесь касается руководства по слип-боксу, как вы используете слип-бокс Николаса Люмена, строго говоря, у Люмена есть два разных слип-бокса, у него есть биографический, библиографический, есть биографический, библиографический, который содержит ссылки и  краткие заметки о содержании литературы, и основная из них, в которой он собирал и генерировал свои идеи, главным образом в ответ на прочитанное, заметки записывались на учетных карточках и хранились в деревянных ящиках, и всякий раз, когда он что-то читал, он записывал библиографическую информацию. одну сторону карточки и делать краткие заметки о содержании на другой стороне. Эти заметки окажутся в библиографическом ящике на втором этапе вскоре после того, как он посмотрит на свои краткие заметки и подумает об их значимости для своего собственного мышления и письма. затем он обращался к основному ящику и записывал свои идеи, комментарии и мысли на новом листе бумаги, используя только один лист для 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=520)~~  каждой идеи и ограничиваясь одной стороной листа, чтобы их было легче прочитать позже, не беря их.  «из коробки» не беря их.  «из коробки» он обычно делал их достаточно краткими, чтобы одна идея уместилась на одном листе, но иногда вы добавляли еще одну заметку, чтобы расширить мысль, поэтому идея с ящиком для документов здесь для меня действительно революционная, часто мы пытаемся делать заметки в особый контекст, и мы думаем, что нам будет полезно что-то запомнить, но мы можем думать об этом процессе как об интеллектуальных картах, которые я делал до того, как каждая из них была хороша сама по себе, но на самом деле они не имели никакой связи с другими интеллектуальными картами  это означает, что это было хорошее упражнение, чтобы попытаться вспомнить что-то для меня, но оно не так уж полезно для всех нас, когда мы сейчас пытаемся создать что-то полезное из контента с помощью метода выдвижного ящика, для которого я использую обсидиан.  в том, что я использую этот инструмент, я беру все эти заметки в одном и том же месте, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=576)~~  их можно соединить и сделать из них в любой момент в будущем без особых трений, есть также кое-что, что можно сказать, я думаю, для двоих  различные типы думаю, для двоих  различные типы библиографических заметок - это как брать цитаты и авторов, которых я выделяю из книг, их легко и быстро записать, и есть кое-что, что вы можете делать во время чтения и не прерывать свой рабочий процесс. Следующий фрагмент похож на размышления или  излагать вещи своими словами, и это то, о чем они много говорят внутри, чтобы это прижилось, я рекомендую вам пойти и посмотреть эту книгу, если вы еще не читали ее, они говорят о том, как выразить что-то своими словами  действительно мощный инструмент памяти, но теперь, исходя из того, как делать умные заметки, он также дает нам возможность подумать о том, как работа вписывается в наше более широкое представление обо всей системе, и, конечно, это именно то, что мы пытаемся сделать с нашей  карта, а также все в порядке, каковы основные идеи обучения, каковы основные идеи потенциальных привычек или других вещей, таких как фокус 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=633)~~  и вещи, которые я хочу знать, каковы основные идеи и что с этим связано, поэтому я хочу создать свое представление мира, и я делаю это с помощью этих карт контента, которые также являются голубыми узлами, поэтому следующая часть, о которой мы говорим, поэтому следующая часть, о которой мы говорим, - это просто процесс ведения умных заметок, вероятно, это большая часть того, о чем мы думаем.  примерно здесь, так что процесс на самом деле состоит из пяти различных шагов. Первый - делать мимолетные заметки. Всегда иметь что-то под рукой, чтобы записать каждую идею, которая приходит вам в голову. Не беспокойтесь слишком сильно о том, как вы ее записываете или что вы пишете. это мимолетные заметки, просто напоминания о том, что у вас в голове, они не должны отвлекать, поместите их в одно место и определите как своего рода ваш почтовый ящик и обработайте их позже, следующее - делать литературные заметки, поэтому всякий раз, когда вы что-то читаете делайте заметки о содержании, записывайте то, что вы не хотите забыть, и подумайте о том, что вы могли бы использовать в 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=688)~~  своих собственных размышлениях или письме, вы хотите, чтобы это было очень коротким, будьте предельно избирательны и используйте свои собственные слова, номер три — делать постоянные заметки теперь обратитесь к своему ящику, конечно, просмотрите свои записи, которые вы сделали на шаге номер один и два, в идеале один раз в день, прежде чем вы забудете, что это значит, и подумайте о том, как они связаны с тем, что актуально для вас, а также вашего собственного исследовательского мышления и интересов. шаг номер четыре — добавить свои постоянные заметки в ящик для документов, заполняя каждую за другой, складывая одну за другой и т. д., мы не будем вдаваться в подробности, потому что каждый будет использовать свои собственные инструменты, но номер пять — это просто  разрабатывать свои собственные темы, вопросы, исследовать и думать об этом снизу вверх, изнутри системы, видеть, что там, чего не хватает и какие вопросы возникают, так что на самом деле это инструмент, который я создал, и эта цитата действительно как бы просто говорит  Само по 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=741)~~  себе, независимо от того, какой инструмент вы используете, это процесс ведения умных заметок, но позвольте мне объяснить, как я это делаю понемногу на каждом из этих шагов. Шаг номер один — это, конечно, делать мимолетные заметки, и для меня это выглядит так  чтение или прослушивание книги и выделение важных моментов из книги, которые, я думаю, войдут в мое резюме, это здорово, потому что у него также есть возможность хранить их внутри облака, и это действительно ограничивает трение, которое происходит на шаге  номер два для меня — это программа для чтения электронных книг, которая на самом деле позволяет мне делать небольшие заметки по каждому важному моменту, и я использую этот раздел, чтобы установить любые связи с предыдущими идеями, которые я хотел бы запомнить, когда перейду к шагу номер три. Шаг номер три — это  когда я копирую блики в обсидиан и добавляю свои собственные отражения, я организую их, я стараюсь выполнить от шести до восьми пунктов в книге. Шаг номер четыре. К счастью, я могу выполнить шаги номер три и четыре вместе 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=793)~~  с обсидианом, поскольку он имеет действительно отличную взаимосвязь. система, которая представляет собой карту на графике, который вы видите прямо здесь. Я только что связал одну страницу с другой, и я могу легко видеть ее внутри графика и перемещаться по своему усмотрению. Шаг номер пять — двигаться дальше к настоящему моменту, поэтому вместо этого  просто из краткого изложения книг, я постараюсь изложить полные темы, ответить на вопросы и сформировать свои собственные аргументы с помощью заметок, которые я уже создал, на самом деле, быстрый плагин для того, как я прочитал и суммировал 100 разных книг, - это мой самый первый вид  исследовательской заметки, я позвоню им, так что вы сможете проверить это на канале, который скоро появится, поэтому наша следующая идея — это просто инструменты для ведения умных заметок, так что на самом деле есть четыре разных вещи, которые мы хотим сохранить  ум для ведения умных заметок, подготовка инструментов не должна занимать больше пяти-десяти минут, и в идеале она встроена в мою систему, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=848)~~  но наличие правильных инструментов - это одна часть уравнения, которую легко обмануть.  их простота, многие опробовали их, не понимая, как с ними работать, понимая, как с ними работать, и были ожидаемо разочарованы результатами. Инструменты хороши настолько, насколько хороши ваши способности с ними работать, и я могу сказать, что мне потребовалось довольно много времени, чтобы точно понять  как я хотел, чтобы обсидиан работал на меня, вам нужно что-то, чтобы фиксировать идеи, когда и где бы они ни приходили вам в голову, где бы вы ни использовали, что бы вы ни использовали, это не должно требовать никаких мыслей, внимания или нескольких шагов, чтобы записать это в системе, которая есть в справочной системе  две разные цели — сбор ссылок и заметок, которые вы делаете во время чтения. Некоторые предпочитают старомодную версию с ручкой и бумагой, а не деревянную коробку, и это нормально, но компьютеры действительно могут ускорить относительно незначительную часть работы в уравнении.  в любом случае такие вещи, как добавление ссылок и форматирование 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=906)~~  ссылок, конечно, думать и создавать - это самая сложная часть, и создавать - это самая сложная часть, наконец, редактор, и мы не будем слишком много говорить об этом, но, к счастью, обсидиан не является огромной заглушкой для обсидиана, но это круто  инструмент не так уж и много, что вам действительно нужно для умных заметок, бумажный блокнот и флэш-карта могут быть лучшим вариантом для вас, и это здорово, я бы сказал, однако есть несколько инструментов, которые лично мне нравится использовать для каждого из этих шагов первый шаг: я использую два разных инструмента: сначала я использую плеер для аудиокниг, и я знаю, что для некоторых из нас это богохульство, но это позволяет мне получать информацию в любое время в пути, что для меня отлично, но не очень хорошо для  создание заметок или запись мыслей, так что на самом деле у меня также есть версия электронной книги, которую я использую, чтобы выделять и делать заметки одновременно на одном и том же устройстве, использую ли я свой телефон, iPad или что-то в этом роде, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=957)~~  шаг номер два, устройство для чтения электронных книг  Обычно я использую возможность собрать все свои основные моменты и заметки в одном разделе, поэтому я поднимаю его и использую в качестве постоянного справочного руководства, когда перехожу к шагу номер три, который является инструментом, в котором мы находимся правильно теперь, и это, по сути, мой обсидиан в моей коробке, это потрясающий способ запечатлеть как ссылки, так и размышления, а также организовать мои заметки таким образом, чтобы это имело для меня смысл. Шаг номер четыре - обсидиан действительно охватывает и этот шаг, без особой необходимости об этом думать, это  использование редактора уценок, изучение которого может занять некоторое время, если вы не знакомы, но это действительно простой способ писать и форматировать, поэтому определенно рекомендую проверить этот процесс. Следующая идея и последняя идея на самом деле — мыслить нестандартно.  творчеству нельзя мыслить нестандартно.  творчеству нельзя научить как правилу или подходу к плану, но мы можем быть уверены, что наша рабочая 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=1013)~~  среда позволяет нам творчески подходить к идеям, это также помогает сохранять разум, помогает сохранять в уме некоторую креативность, креативность, вызывающая идеи о проблеме. решение, которое может показаться нелогичным, стоит немного остановиться на этой теме, прежде чем перейти к следующему шагу — подготовке чернового варианта рукописи. Настоящий враг независимого мышления — это не внешний авторитет, а наша собственная инерция, способность  Генерация новых идей больше связана с разрушением старых привычек мышления, чем с выдвижением как можно большего количества новых идей по понятным причинам. Я не рекомендую мыслить нестандартно, наоборот, здесь мы можем превратить ящик для слипов в инструмент для взлома.  из наших собственных привычек мышления, наш мозг просто любит рутину, прежде чем новая информация побуждает наш мозг думать по-другому о чем-то, он может использовать новую информацию, чтобы вписаться в известное, или позволить ей полностью исчезнуть из нашего восприятия, обычно мы даже не замечаем, когда наш 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=1076)~~  мозг  изменить наше окружение, чтобы оно соответствовало его ожиданиям, поэтому нам нужна небольшая хитрость, чтобы лишить рутинное мышление, поэтому я думаю об этом так, что рутинное мышление - это то, как устроен наш разум, потому что у нас есть миллиарды бит данных, поступающих к нам каждый божий день, это, конечно, здорово, потому что это означает, что мы не прикованы к дивану и не думаем о том, как странно, что вся вселенная, вы знаете, постоянно находится прямо над нами, да, мы плывем по этому  кабриолет, что действительно странно, но что касается по-настоящему творческой работы, то это не так уж и хорошо, это другое, потому что ваш мозг полностью работает на автопилоте, поэтому саке указывает, что здесь лучшим способом может быть инверсия общей фразы, а также  Я рекомендую вам пойти и проверить инверсию, которая взята из книги Шейна Пэриша, том номер один «Великие ментальные модели», в котором все рассказывается об инверсии и о том, как вы можете использовать ее для стимулирования новых идей, поэтому здесь мыслить нестандартно 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=1140)~~  хуже, чем думать внутри  коробка, и теперь у нас есть все эти идеи, эти ссылки, эти заметки, и это процесс ведения этих заметок, создания ссылок и ваших размышлений, а затем предоставление коробке возможности придумать идеи, связи на пути к вашему письму и творчеству.  работайте для меня сейчас, чтобы создать видео, все, что мне нужно, это искра идеи, в которой у меня нет недостатка, пока я читаю, и тогда я смогу найти несколько связей, даже если они кажутся совершенно не связанными, и создать совершенно новое видео  Менее чем за час это настоящая сила умных заметок, так что это шесть больших идей. Подготовка, а не iq Николас Люмен. У нас есть руководство по коробке, есть процесс ведения умных заметок, инструменты для умных заметок и мыслите внутри коробки. Теперь мы рассмотрим несколько различных инструментов. Первый — это просто процесс ведения умных заметок, который мы уже рассмотрели, но я также хочу поговорить о чем-то от Джима Квика, который называется «быстрая модель», а затем о цифровом отвлечении внимания. ваша зависимость, чтобы вы 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=1203)~~  действительно могли воплотить в жизнь любую из этих идей, поэтому более быстрая модель является номером один, поэтому у нас есть более быстрая модель, у нас есть аббревиатура, означающая забыть, действовать, состояние, научить, ввести обзор, поэтому мне очень нравится эта модель  и вся идея, по сути, в том, что вам нужно сделать здесь, это следовать этой более быстрой модели, и я не буду рассматривать каждую деталь, но раньше я делал это перед каждой интеллект-картой, и во время чтения я делаю две вещи, которые вы надо выключить телефон и забыть обо всех отвлекающих факторах, пока я составляю карты мыслей, это на самом деле процесс обучения, или пока я пишу эти заметки, это мой процесс обучения для состояния, я всегда слушаю музыку, пока записываю свои  заметки, но пока я читаю, я никогда не слушаю музыку, следующее - преподавание, и, конечно, именно для этого и предназначены эти видео. Следующее - это ввод, поэтому эти видео являются прекрасным примером входа. Каждую неделю я обязуюсь делать одно видео, так что 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=1263)~~  вы хотите внести что-то в свой календарь, а следующим будет обзор, так вот в чем для меня прелесть того, как делать умные заметки, это, по сути, просто сказать: « ОК, вы знаете, я делаю эти заметки, но сейчас»  теперь у меня есть способ сослаться на это, у меня есть способ вернуться и, по сути, заново выучить вещи, вернуться к вещам, и это тоже чрезвычайно важно, поэтому важно иметь в своих заметках место, где вы можете возвращаться и переучивать вещи снова и снова в следующий раз  Инструмент, о котором я хотел поговорить, - это цифровое отвлечение, и это, конечно, что-то, что исходит от штата Калифорния в Ньюпорте, и вы более чем можете присоединиться к каналу и получить все эти инструменты для себя, но как нам побороть цифровую зависимость, правда?  включает в себя три разных шага: номер один: настройка некоторых правил, некоторые примеры правил: не устанавливайте приложения для социальных сетей на телефоне, отключите уведомления и установите блокировщики сайтов на рабочем компьютере. Это три хороших правила. Следующий фрагмент — найдите другое.  чем 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YEErA8QKAs&t=1324)~~  заняться, не сидите и не смотрите в стену, а найдите дела, которые вам нравятся, которые не связаны с технологиями.  В целом, эта цифровая зависимость, мы хотим убедиться, что мы планируем временные интервалы, в течение которых вы собираетесь намеренно использовать социальные сети, поэтому определенно стоит заглянуть туда. Я действительно рекомендую вам присоединиться к каналу YouTube, получить доступ к инструментам, получить доступ ко всем  Различные инструменты, которые мы создали, всем  Различные инструменты, которые мы создали, каждая белая точка здесь — это новый инструмент, который вы можете внедрить в свою жизнь, от лучших авторов мира, это было «Как делать умные заметки» Сонки Аренс, действительно, очень, спасибо, что вы со мной.  сегодня здесь,
