 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=0)~~  is this live or is this a green screen is this the original blue chair you'll never know so today what i'd like to discuss is this concept of being investable if you wish to have other people invest in you then you need to be investible when i was a younger teenager around the age of 13 14 when i first got the internet i was honestly an arrogant little snot i didn't know jack [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about anything but i thought everybody owed me an explanation of everything because i just knew what they knew i'd be able to sort out the world and it wasn't until i turned around 16 or 17 that i understood that if i wanted other people to be open to teaching me i needed to be investable what do i mean by be investable when people invest in stocks it's because they expect them to go up they expect them to pay dividends so i put this much in i get this much out and when people are giving you information for free often it is not just because they want to be an encyclopedia they just want to control p their brain they actually want 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=52)~~  to see you run and do something with it they want to see you accomplish something there are a lot of people out there that are willing to give away information for free they've made it in life they've made enough money they've had enough accomplishments to feel like they are secure where they are in the world what makes them feel good is helping the next generation achieve their goals is seeing what somebody else can do with how how they could take the knowledge they have in their head and make it work for them in a manner that benefits the world however if you demonstrate that you are not going to do anything with the knowledge you are given you are not demonstrating that you are investable and if you don't demonstrate that you're investable nobody's going to put any time into you now something that i notice is that when people are willing to take time out of their day to explain something to somebody else and it goes nowhere often they're not going to say why they stopped responding they're not going to say why they stop replying they're going 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=99)~~  to not going to say why they're not helping you anymore because they don't want to be called rude or being an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for just speaking the truth so i would like to explain this concept and i'd like to give an example and i really don't want to call out this particular person this happens a bunch of times every single day but it happens to be a decent example somebody said i don't know if you'll see this but i would appreciate any help i can get i have this 2011 macbook pro the batteries fried so i had to keep it connected to the wall i recently bought a battery and it clearly works because i can plug it in and it will turn on and if i unplug it it will stay on the reason why i need your help is because i can't turn it on when it's only using the battery and you know i would honestly appreciate any help so my question is okay this person's seen my videos they've seen enough of it to find my contact email so i figured maybe they've watched some of the border pair stuff or they at least know that there is a board repair guide 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=142)~~  out there that i spend time writing 150 pages into and that i have you know a basic electronics video series all this so my question is i'm willing to help what is pp3v42 underscore g3 hot and pp bus g3 with only the battery present he sends me a video that has absolutely nothing to do with my qu my question it says uh you know i tried to figure out what pp bus g3 hot and pp3 421 g3 hot r but that's much more in depth than i am used to you know i'm sorry if i'm incompetent i'm not very good at this type of stuff and point take it people are not always good at things so if i said you know okay measure a power rail for me and i have a video called what is a power rail i have videos on what what is ppbush g3 hot and what is pp3v42 underscore g3 hot and what is its purpose in a circuit i have a 150 page guide that has pictures and size 72 font that literally walks you through this as if you are a preschooler and you decide i am going to read none of that i am not going to answer your question rather i'm just going to demonstrate that i am 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=197)~~  completely and utterly helpless and incapable of looking up anything what you're doing in my mind is you're demonstrating that you are uninvestable that if i tell you okay that is a power rail that you're going to go what is a power rail when i explain what a power rail is you're going to say how do i measure it when i tell you use a multimeter you're going to say how do i use a multimeter when i say turn it to volts you're going to say what is volt you get you get my drift like there i know at that point that no matter again i know because i've gone down this path before that no matter how much information i give you there's always going to be a follow-up because you're unwilling to do any of the work required to actually find the answer that demonstrates that you're uninvestable as you currently are and if you are uninvestable then i can't invest time into you if you're not going to do anything with what i give you then i am wasting my time because again if i'm going to help you out for free and i've helped out many people free that's part 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=243)~~  of what this entire channel was for i need to know that there's actually some small tiny chance of there being a positive outcome 100 no even 50 or 30 percent no but it's gotta be like above five or ten percent you must understand that people who were at the top of their craft at the top of their field the people that i was engaging with when i was a teenager at avatar studios progressive and everywhere else they get nothing out of taking time out of their day that they could spend making 75 an hour fixing studio gear for other people teaching some teenager [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they get nothing out of that other than the feeling that something is going to work again that otherwise wouldn't work that their knowledge is being passed on and is going to be used in a productive way if i rob them of that they have no incentive whatsoever to teach me jack [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it would be selfish of me to rob them of that by not respecting the information they've given me enough to show them that i can run a little bit with it before i ask my follow-up 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=298)~~  question so i responded okay i have about 600 videos a 150-page guide it describes what all this stuff is i mean this in the nicest way possible but if you're not willing to put in even the most basic time investment to learn the most basic things from my pre-existing content and resources i'm not walking you through the step by step you're demonstrating a lack of respect for the information i've put out there already and my time and many people are not going to say that they are just going to hit the lead on the email they are going to hang up the phone or they are just going to stop talking to you and the reason i say this is because all of the success that i've had all the stuff that i've gotten to learn at a young age i got to learn because i learned how to be investable i'm still friends with the people on the internet forum that used to just kick my ass regularly for being a stupid teenager i remember i was like when i was 13 one of the people on the forum was 20 and we're actually still friends today i was horribly immature 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=348)~~  and i acted like this on a regular basis it was very entitled very douchey young teenager but it took me changing that in order to get people to actually give me information when i started working at avatar studios i was 17 years old and completely clueless about everything so i would sometimes ask a question what is this and they would answer and i wouldn't then immediately say okay what is that well that's c okay so what is c c is d okay what is d d is this i wouldn't start doing that i would take that information and then i would google it a little bit i would look some stuff up i read the tape op forms i read the gear slots forms which admittedly were more cancerous than the tape hop forms i'd read the womb forms i'd ask the other interns and then i would mess with something on my own i would go to like let's say the parts box in the tech room and i would start pulling apart something just to get an idea so i wouldn't be working on the main console and then once i had 30 or 45 minutes of research in i would say okay here's what 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=398)~~  i came up with then i would give my next question what that did is that told roy hendrickson that told ricky began that told phil and gretchen i was actually taking the information they gave me and running with it i wasn't just going to stay still with the information they gave me and then wait for them to give me another to go over here and then another go over here another go over here to drive them nuts if they gave me this information i would run as far as i could with it maybe this is as far as i get but at least i ran some place with it so they can see that i'm actually doing something with the information which means that they are going to give me more information into the future if they are going to help me again then i may get even further with that particular information and this is something that i think is very important when it is you're trying to learn something new or do something new if you want people to invest in you another example that i could give other than just learning board repair or stuff like 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=443)~~  this or asking please bro types of questions via email is something like let's say a non-profit so now as i said there was a donor that gave a million bucks to my non-profit really cool thanks nice very very happy very happy that they were generous enough to do that now if i were to go back to them and ask for more money what you think would be better if i asked them for more money immediately or if i say hey look we got a bill passed in new york state where we've been laughed out of the legislature for seven years we got a bill passed in colorado we were laughed at last year we got the ftc to actually start releasing papers demonstrating that much of the arguments that come from the anti-right to repair side are wrong with citations and it's over 50 pages and this is now a mass media issue this is all the work that we have done here's how far we got again it's not where we need to be but look we started here now we're here what do you think will get you a better result if i demonstrate that i moved from here to here with what 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=498)~~  you gave me or if i just stayed over here and did nothing and then said give me give me another million bucks i don't want to go back to this person and ask for a dime more money until i've demonstrated that i can massively move the needle with the money that i have received in spite of the fact that i'm working against other companies that probably spend anywhere from 50 to 200 million dollars a year lobbying against all of this stuff in the state of massachusetts they spent over 26 million dollars in one year alone trying to convince people that auto mechanics were rapists and burglars you know people have commented every now and then why don't you promote fighttorrepair.org more why don't you promote your non-profits i don't want to go back to that large donor or any of you and ask for a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dime until i demonstrate with them with the money that we have already received that i can move the needle from over here to over here that we can get from being considered a joke for six or seven years to making 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=545)~~  progress like that inside of a year if i'm able to do that then i will be able to come back to you like a man and say we would like more money here's why we deserve it here's why we should get it here's what we're going to do with it you understand where i'm coming from do you understand what i'm saying you want to demonstrate that when somebody provides you with any sort of investment that you are not just going to sit there and do nothing and waddle in it but rather you're going to make a run at least make a try some sort of attempt before you go back and ask for more whether we are talking about advice and counsel or whether we are talking about cash dollars do you understand where i'm coming from here do you understand my point i'm not trying to be mean when i talk to people like this i'm really not i want them to understand this because in order to get other people to find them to be investable they are going to have to change their outlook they are going to have to change the way they ask questions they're gonna have to change 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=591)~~  the reward system for the person that is providing them with answers because if you don't give them that little kick a dope mean that comes from oh wow that information i gave me actually did something with it then they're not gonna keep giving you information again if he comes back to me and says okay pp342 is 3.4 volts ppus g3 out is 8.1 volts i don't know what that means i at least know okay cool you measured something you did what i asked you learned what a power rail is you learned how to use a multimeter or something like that i can then at least see okay i now i can give you the next hint and know that it's going to go somewhere okay people buy sheet 3 out of supposed to be 8.55 volts you said it's 8.1 volts here's one of two things you may want to check to see why that is and then he says oh yeah well this there was actually a little bit of green over here okay yeah there's a little bit of green over there what does that mean and i can go what do you think it means like we can have a back and forth but if you 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=636)~~  respond with i'm just gonna ignore every single thing that you have posted for the past eight to ten years in this channel i'm going to pretend you never posted a guide i'm going to pretend you never posted these videos i want you to spoon feed me everything type me a 15-page paper from scratch even though you have a 150-page paper already how do you think i'm going to respond to that really truly honestly how do you think i am going to respond to that and here's the thing i'm going to take a guess that this person is young based on the email and the way it was written i'm going to guess probably teenager high school early high school so they probably had no idea that the way they were asking their question actually had this bit of tinge of disrespect to it the same way that when i was on one of these forums back 20 years ago i can't believe i'm that old i got the internet in 2002. that when i was asking questions and when i was interfacing with the community that i was doing so in a very disrespectful manner that made other 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=686)~~  people not want to deal with me which is why i'm making this video so hopefully you kind of get an idea of where i'm coming from if you want people to give you answers if you want people to invest in you instead of invest time in whatever they're doing demonstrate that you're investable demonstrate that people are not wasting their time when they put their time and effort into you and you will get a better outcome from it you may think i don't have to do that why bother why should i change bloody bloody blah when i was 18 years old i was able to go out into manhattan and freelance at other recording studios charging 75 an hour to fix people's recording consoles in other studios when other people at 26 years old were just starting at avatar studios as an intern why because i was able to convince and motivate and incentivize other people to give me information for free that other people would have had to pay money for and probably still not gotten in the amount of time that i did they believed it was worth their time to show me 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=736)~~  something and i want everybody who's watching this video to make other people that are smarter than them that have more skills and that they want to be able to make those men people want to be mentors to them there's this one guy in this one chip masters forum that i remember talking to his name was duke and i have two videos really demonstrating my appreciation for this gentleman as a great mentor to me when it comes to border pair and i remember he answered one question that i had i sent him 300 i didn't even know if that was his paypal email if we'll go to spam i sent him 300 bucks he responded thinking it was a mistake saying you know in the past four years i've posted on this forum i think i've gotten about 13 or 17 dollars in total once and i said listen you answered my question answering my the answer you gave me led to me learning all these other things and looking into all these other things and it helped me do a repair so i want to say thank you and for years any time i had any sort of question i could 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rufif247scI&t=787)~~  always ping him and like it was the start of a great mentoring relationship and it's because i hope i hope i demonstrated that if he teaches me something if he just points something out to me that i missed that it's not a waste of his time because i will figure it out and even if i don't figure it out well at least i respect you enough to give you some money for it just something to think about just some food for thought let me know what you think in the comments down below that's it for today and as always i hope you learned something i'll see you all in the next

У меня есть этот MacBook Pro 2011 года, батареи сгорели, поэтому мне пришлось держать его подключенным к стене. Я недавно купил аккумулятор и он явно работает, потому что я могу подключить его, и он включится, а если я отключу его, он останется включенным. Причина, по которой мне нужна ваша помощь, заключается в том, что я не могу включить его, когда он работает только от батареи, и вы знаете, я бы это сделал  честно благодарен за любую помощь, так что мой вопрос в порядке, этот человек видел мои видео, он посмотрел достаточно, чтобы найти мой контактный адрес электронной почты, поэтому

Я не могу сказать, что

Демонстрируете неуважение к информации, которую я уже разместил, и к моему времени, и многие люди не собираются говорить, что они просто перейдут в атаку по электронной почте, они собираются повесить трубку или они  мы просто перестанем с вами разговаривать, и причина, по которой я это говорю, заключается в том, что весь успех, которого я добился, все то, чему

Когда я задавал вопросы и общался с сообществом, я делал это очень неуважительно, из-за чего другие люди не хотели иметь со мной дело, поэтому я делаю это. Если вы хотите, чтобы люди давали вам ответы, если вы хотите, чтобы люди инвестировали в вас, а не тратили время на то, что они делают, продемонстрируйте, что в вас можно инвестировать, продемонстрируйте, что люди не тратят свое время зря, когда они вкладывают в вас свое время и усилия, и вы получите от этого лучший результат, вы можете подумать, что мне не нужно этого делать, зачем беспокоиться, почему я должен меняться,
