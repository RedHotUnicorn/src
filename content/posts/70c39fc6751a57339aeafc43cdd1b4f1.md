# Description 
Building A Second Brain is about building a digital system that you can trust to resurface the information you need in whatever context you might need it.

In this video I break down how I use Logseq and Tana to manage reference information and all my action items.

 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=0)~~  building a second brain is all about building a digital system that you can trust to manage the information in your life such that you can resurface what you need when you need it the reality is that we live in an age of information overload and it's very difficult for our meat brains to be able to handle all the things that we need to handle but the truth is you don't need to handle everything in your brain because there are digital systems that you can build to offload this work too and the reality is that you doing a lot of this work already you might just be doing it very inefficiently that means that you're switching between apps you're going between your emails to find what tasks you need to do I'm also guilty of doing the same thing so this is not an inquisition but the whole idea of building a second brain is building a system that does this work for you now the way we go about this is the art of personal Knowledge Management or the practice depending on how you look at it and personal Knowledge Management is 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=57)~~  nothing new it's just become popularized by Iago photo's course and his book building a second brain a number of people in the community have expressed that they don't like this naming but I've since come around to it because I also was in that boat where I didn't want to treat my knowledge as a project and I spoke in an earlier video about building a digital knowledge garden and indeed some of those sentiments still apply I don't think we should have everything as a project and like treat ourselves as some personal self-development robot but still we can really help ourselves by building effective systems I'm also quite glad that I've taken so long to do this video because initially it would have been about a single app I.E building a second brain in log seek but I've come to realize that building a second brain is not about the app it's about a system of applications and how they work together and how you interface with the apps so over the last few years T has joined the fold omnivore has joined the fold and 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=116)~~  this has really enabled me to build a more complete system which I'm excited to share with you today so some quick housekeeping this is what we're going to talk about but before we talk about that I've got a little plant here because I've got a whiteboard and you might hear that the audio is a little bit reverberating so I need to fix this in the new but for now I've become a professional YouTub and I've got my little house plant here but uh yeah let's now get back into the video the first thing I going to speak about is a second brain is not an app I've already spoken a little bit to that I'm just going to put a few more comments there and then going to look at Thiago Forte's code process important insight for me is looking at reference versus action and why I'm now so satisfied with this then we're going to go into the capture Deep dive which is the C then organize overview which is the O and then specific benefits of the different applications and then we're going to conclude and wrap it up for the year now this may seem strange if I'm making a 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=172)~~  video about log seek Anana but if you looking for one app to rule them all that app for you is probably obsidian obsidian is super powerful got lots of plugins and that's the important part that you can really extend your workflows and yeah customize it as you want but I was watching a video by Danny Hatcher who really cemented this idea for me that the second brain is not about an app if you're familiar with Danny's work you'll know that he is the king of obsidian or at least one of the Kings there's a few of them and in his building a second brain video he talks about how this is not one app he's using obsidian for his notes zero for his references and then Morgan for his calendar and and tasks so despite the fact that you can do everything on obsidian doesn't mean that you should do everything in obsidian it might actually be making your life a little bit more complicated and the same goes for me and log seek trying to do everything in log seek or being able to do everything in log seek is theoretically possible just 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=228)~~  a lot more difficult to execute well so my second brain is built predominantly using log seek and T but I'm also using omnivore and rewies to move information around so before we get into my system in general let's have a look at actually how you go about building a second brain so the code process is Thiago Forte's methodology for how we manage information and the C in code is capture capture is where we go and store the information into our second brain and Thiago recommends using readed later apps so that we're not inundated with information and having to make decisions all the time of where we want to go and what want to read but here you use your read later app so that you can consciously return to that information later the other aspect here is just being able to quickly capture a note so if you're on the go and you want to just write a note it's being able to have your note app handy so that you can very easily enter your thoughts so that you don't forget them okay so that's the C it's really capturing the key insights 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=293)~~  not all the information that you read although some people do that but that I don't think is the best way to go about it the o is organize so organizing is about making sure that you can find that information again and for me I like to keep it very simple I just use tags and yeah hashtags and links and when I use it in ch I add a little bit of structure to that with the fields but really it's trying to keep it such that it's loose and flexible I'm not trying to build this rigid hierarchy that I can find absolutely everything that everything has its own place it's really by like finding the mental connections rather than having this rigid folder hierarchy the D is distill distill means to like you know Bubble Up The Core insights and make those available to yourself Thiago talks about Progressive summarization where you go through your highlights for instance of a book that you read and then you progressively bold the most important parts and then hypothetically even highlight with markdown highlighter in log seek the key 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=354)~~  parts so that you can go and find them again very easily and also reshuffle them in such a way that makes it useful to you the E is for Express and expressing is where you publish those thoughts or make them available to others in order to generate value for yourself now if you are not working in a field or you don't have a YouTube channel on the side or you're not writing a blog or something these last two might seem a little bit Superfluous and I might actually agree with you there I think Thiago would say that if you distill something and express it it can have the form of a checklist for for instance where for your work you can you know refer back to this checklist so it's not always about having something that you necessarily publish but I think for the majority of knowledge workers we don't have these side projects where we are talking about all personal Knowledge Management systems on YouTube so those two are not that applicable you might want to make it discuss and execute and then you use tools like Microsoft Excel 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=416)~~  to build your model and that's your execution or you use PowerPoint like I'm using here to communicate visually so it doesn't have to be you know all steps for you but the most important parts there for me are capture and organize and that's what I'm going to get into now but before we get there I want to talk about this important distinction of action versus reference and this is something that really resonated for me when I watched one of thiago's later videos it's this idea of that when you capture information you need to decide if it's actionable or if it's not so ask yourself a question is it actionable if not it goes into your reference system if it needs to change form then it goes into your notes app and that's where you're reshuffling things and yeah making sense of it later as you go if not it goes into your file storage now your file storage might be one drive or whatever system you are using and I want to emphasize here that this is not a perfect rule so for instance when you are using PDFs I when I'm using PDFs I 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=479)~~  actually put them into to log seek which is my notes app you might want to put them into your file storage if you are managing images if you a photographer or something you definitely want to have a file storage system and you're going to be changing the form of those using Photoshop so this is not Universal I'm just trying to sort of synthesize what I took out of it and hopefully give you some ideas okay on the actionable side you then need to ask is there a time component if not goes into your task management app if there is it goes into your calendar so that's where you schedule it now again there not perfectly um well the delineation here is not perfect for me because I am able to put time components in Tona so there is the mishmash of those two things but really those are the two hemispheres in your brain you could talk about hemispheres it's actionable and reference and for me a big part of my focus in the last few years has been on the reference side of things so specifically on the notes app looking at log seek capturing information 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=542)~~  organizing it so that I can resurface it later and this is where it really helps to have a good system because when you are solving a problem that you have looked at information for before you've done some research before you don't have to go back to Google redo all the work find those Google searches find that article that you sure that you read it's all in your system that you can refer back to later so now we're getting into the capture Deep dive and I've put this um on Lucid chart so that I can share it with you the link will be in the video description and you can see it's just looking at the first part of code which is capture and I'm showing here the delineation of what is reference and what is actionable so let's jump into the reference side the first part is personal writing and I talk about this in my course but I really think about it in well I actually think about capture in four things the other one there is the external input that is the fourth thing so the first one is free form thinking and writing so 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=605)~~  basically if I'm doing interstitial Journey journaling bullet journaling or if I'm just taking observations as I go like a quick thought I put that into log seek into my daily journals why is this Tana logo there well when I'm on the go I think Tana is got an excellent capture app so I just quickly record a voice note and transcribe it which I've spoken about in another video so sometimes I use T as an intermediary but everything still goes into log seek the second Point here is Project based thinking and writing so if I got meeting notes a project scratch Pad where I'm like just talking about different ideas and fleshing things out that also goes into log seek also starting point daily journals then building a reference bank so documentation or helpful Snippets to remember that also goes into log seek daily journal and sometimes that is also using screenshots um but here we see these external inputs and let's go here I've actually got a screenshot there which shows that I use snagit so I do use snagit which is a screen or screen 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=676)~~  capture tool but it still goes into log seek so building a reference Bank some documentation I can take the text I can copy and paste that into log seek or I can just take a screenshot and paste this screenshot into log seek 2 now this other tool that I use here as I say snagged very cool I'm making another video from other channel where I look at some other productivity tools but the focus here is the second brain then for other external inputs so Chrome or your internet bookmarks and Twitter I manually add these to omnivore so omnivore is a readed later app a lot of people use readwise as reader I don't really like reader because it exports everything as a page and I like to have my pages reserved for higher levels of information so you can see here I've got this omnivore what do you call it browser extension and I can just quickly click that or say share to omnivore and then it goes into omnivore I then read omnivore or read in omnivore which has its own app and then I import that into an omnivore import page in log seek okay 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=746)~~  forgotten to speak about these two points all my email newsletters and substack recommendations Etc also automatically go into omnio everything is fed there my inbox is very it's all available for me when I want to read in omnivore and I find that I don't read as much as I used to and I don't feel like the pressure to read because I've really enjoyed picking up physical books again and yeah focusing on that for my reading okay the next two things here are podcasts so this is using the snipped application uh snipped allows you to capture recordings of the podcast and it gives you the transcription I then export that and put it into log seek again I don't do it as much as I used to so that's why it's not a big focus on my workflow and then PDFs get uploaded into my daily journals as well just for slash upload in goes a PDF but you can see here that the PDF gets its own annotations hls page and that goes into a seate page in log seek so that means that when I want to look for annotations they are available in that hls page Log 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=817)~~  seek does that automatically I don't have to worry about that the next part here is the my Kindle highlights so when I do annotations on Kindle it goes into readwise and readwise then exports that into a separate page now for a book I don't really mind because then there's a lot of information that goes in there and then I can reshuffle it but for every article that I read if I've got like one little highlight or whatever I don't want that to get a separate page it must just go into the journal so again this is where I like having this Daily Journal first workflow and then when things need to be elevated or when I can distill and express them then I move them into separate pages okay so that's all available for me in log seek and yeah I've got a system of tags which I'll speak to a little bit later so just to zoom out here reference is really about you know keeping things that you want to go and refer back to later it sounds a bit dumb there but like if I am doing any learning or any like project documentation or something like that I 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=877)~~  really want to be able to find that so log seek becomes the wiki for that information for me really easy don't have to do too many things manually I've got a lot of things automated and yeah I know that I can find things with ease in log seek by either using search query it's all there action on on the other hand talks about you know you know to-do items lists that sort of thing like if you've got meetings even you can think of that as an action as I said I take my action or my meeting notes in log seek that's just a personal preference thing so let's have a look at some of these actions here for tasks and to-dos well I just use the hashtag tasks for my tasks and then reminders and lists okay so I speak here about clear lists and then fuzzy lists on the clear list side like things to buy or books to read those are my lists that I'm building up in ch and it's really great because then on the super tag page I can Mark what is done and what is not done fuzzy lists are things like inbox like things I might want to discuss with someone feedback 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=948)~~  feedback that I want to give to people I can say hasht feedback and then in the fields I can decide or I can enter who that feedback is for radar that's for things that are on my radar not quite a task but things that I might want to do things that I'm thinking about yeah there's a whole system that I've built that just like you know uses these things it's not 100% perfect but I know that I'll be able to find things when I need them this is not so much on the action side but I'm talking about things that benefit from a structured framework so having ideas and decisions and it gives me a template that I can then build art in t super useful to have in t but you might want to keep track of ideas in log seek or in what other whatever other tool you want I also speak here about my work breakdown structure all my project management happens in Tana because I'm tracking tasks in t so it just makes sense to have everything you know leveled up at that hierarchy so it all goes into T and I know exactly where it is and I can 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1010)~~  find it again by using the super tags T is also got very good queries and a very good search so on the capture side that's really really the high level of what's happening for me as I said I'm also using T capture app and then moving things from my inbox into log seek for long-term storage we're now talking about organized and there is so much that can be said about organized this is really I think where like a lot of my personal work has gone into figuring out what works for me and that's the sort of thing that I share in the courses but for now I just want to talk about this idea of par if you're familiar with building a second brain then you would have heard of par I receive a lot of questions how do I Implement parah in log seek I'm going to speak to that now so parah is the organizational acronym for building a second brain so when you want to organize something Thiago talks about organizing for actionability and it's these four things projects areas resources and archives projects are things that have a due date and a clear 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1075)~~  goal outcome are things with ongoing responsibility so let's think of a project sorry release this video could be a project but it might be you know a project deliverable at work there's a clear deliverable areas are things like Finance where it's like ongoing responsibilities it never closes off resources can be you know your books that you're reading Journal articles PDFs all of those things could be resources archives that is things that or projects that or maybe areas that are no longer active and therefore you don't need to actively manage them this was built with that typical hierarchical folder structure in mind nonetheless it's still helpful to use this breakdown when you are thinking about how you might want to structure your system but you don't have to use this hierarchy rigidly the beauty about modern apps is they have powerful linking and searching capabilities and both log seek with properties and T with Fields give you a lot of power and flexibility to add metadata in order to slice and dice your information up in different ways okay so 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1147)~~  as I said it's probably not the best idea to try and implement this folder structure originally but you can take some of the lessons what are some of these high level tips well for projects I would say use page properties so you could use namespaces but it's not my preference I'm moving away from namespaces for organization because that's quite rigid and hierarchical and I find it's not easy to reorient things later on so in general I'm moving away from them so for T you could just use the hashtag project and that creates a database essentially of all your projects for areas T it's the exact same thing blog seek also the exact same thing so you might want to say I have an area of finance and then I could say this is a type area so the type would be the property and then I would use area as the the value for that property that's just one way of doing it for resources when I input things into log seek I'm using templates that use block properties although when it's a book it uses page properties so that's really how I add the metadata I'm not going in 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1216)~~  adding hashtag book hashtag author hashtag topic it's all in properties so it's systematized and beautiful and then T you could hypothetically have a hashtag resources super tag that gets extended into your books your your movies whatever it is that you are referencing again archive this is more appropriate for folders you know when you have a folder structure in one drive or Google Drive for instance but for log seek or Tana you could use a status field or properties in order to map this again this is just a very quick summary there's a lots of other videos which break this down if you're looking for much more detail I would suggest that you look at the courses because there is a lot more detail on how to organize in both log seek and T So zooming out one more time I just want to have a quick look at the the four tools that I have in this capture workflow and it's omnivore readwise log seek and T so I quickly want to highlight the major benefits of these different applications so log seek is still the first lover in 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1284)~~  some senses and it is open source and free which is a huge win for a lot of people it's also available offline so it works on local files and that should probably be added there it's a true outline so it's super easy to move things around great for distilling ideas and you know just reshuffling everything all my scripts are still done in log seek it's super easy and yeah as I say this like flexibility of tagging is excellent I'm still thinking about how to do a video looking at tags versus super tags if you're interested in that please leave a comment below uh or yeah maybe any other suggestions do you like the plants should I keep the plants I quite like it I think this is something which should have been a little bit earlier but I'm going to leave it in here most of the information that you think you need to remember you can actually forget and this is the beauty of logy because it just goes in there and it doesn't need to have a super tag and be well structured or whatever you don't need to handle everything if you just have one concept 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1344)~~  tag or a backlink that you can find that information again that's all you need I've got the metadata approach well the one where I like systematize my properties and I'll link to a video there that's just a way to make sure that I've got as much detail as I can so that if I'm looking for a video by this person I can triangulate and find that information super easily using filters okay my next love is Stephanie T I really enjoy T the quick capture UI is awesome like just quickly getting something from my phone the AI transcription using whisper a API excellent It's really good for structuring things so if you need things to be structured for instance something in a framework or your project and yeah you want it to be repeatable and all the queries to show up and all the queries to update when you update one query in the template or in the tag super tag T is great for that highly highly recommend I've spoken a little bit about this powerful AI integration they are working a lot on that they really want this to be like an all-in-one workspace 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1408)~~  for a company and I can see how they are going to be a major Challenger to notion in the future as I say it's a tool to look out for and yeah there's a lot of power they got a great team behind them I think they got a lot of VC money as well again some people don't like VC money obsidian are never going to take VC money and that's cool but ton are going to do amazing things I think so yeah watch out for them okay omnivore omnivore is another great tool open source and free and yeah it's been revolutionary in how I manage the information coming in my inbound information the other thing is that you can customize import workflows again I should probably have written this all out here which is really cool for me I didn't find that I could do that as well with readwise and the final thing about omnivore is it exports as blocks which works very well for log seek specifically then readwise is a tool that a lot of people have heard about if you haven't there's a link below which means I'll get free month and I think you get two free months well an extra 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1471)~~  free month to your trial when you sign up so yeah let me know um well vote with your clicks and then uh it's got great Integrations really if you're not using any of these apps and you just watch this video for interest you're using everan note you're using obsidian you're using hept toase readwise integrates with everything it is phenomenal it's also got space petition if that's your thing if you want to revisit different highlights that you've made I found that this was a bit gimmicky stop reading the emails eventually maybe that's just cuz I'm lazy and this will be a big benefit for you so if that's the sort of thing that you like getting emails with your top highlights every day you can also configure that very easily in readwise I've just gone and added the cost here just for transparency log seek is $5 a month for me it's voluntary contribution what that means that I get is as a sponsor on or backer on the open Collective page it means I get access to the sync service so yeah that's just what I like CH it's free for now they're talking 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1530)~~  about being $10 a month but yeah I don't know when that's going to change omnivore is also free for now I don't think they have any plans to increase that just yet but they probably will in the future because it's a great service and I imagine it's costing quite a bit to run and then readwise is $8.99 a month so for $14 basically this is a system that you can build and yeah it's working very well for me so you are likely working with a ton of information in your day-to-day anyways and it's important to develop a good system if it's these apps if it's other apps it doesn't matter but you're really wanting to build a system that you can trust so that you don't have to do all the work up here now there's also great things in doing all the work up here but we're not going to go back to Hunter gather a days where we pass on our information and knowledge via narrative and story so you might as well embrace the times and use the digital tools to help you build this log seek and T are both great applications I use them extensively and 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1592)~~  I've also built courses for both of these applications because there can be quite a learning curve when you're getting started so have a look at log seek Mastery and unlock tana and if you want to buy them as a bundle you can go via my website combining minds.org I'll add the link below and you can get a discounted bundle rate so yeah there's a lot more information in those courses this has just been a quick overview of building a second brain as a concept and just bringing in some of thiago's work so thanks to Thiago for popularizing this and yeah good luck to you with building your second brain see you in the new year and let me know what you

Реальность такова, что мы живем в эпоху информационной перегрузки, и это очень сложно  чтобы наш мясной мозг мог справиться со всем, с чем нам нужно справиться, но правда в том, что вам не нужно обрабатывать все в своем мозгу, потому что есть цифровые системы, которые вы можете создать, чтобы разгрузить и эту работу, и реальность такова. что вы уже выполняете большую часть этой работы, возможно, вы просто делаете это очень неэффективно, это означает, что вы переключаетесь между приложениями, вы просматриваете электронную почту, чтобы найти, какие задачи вам нужно выполнить, я тоже виноват в том, что делаю то же самое  Итак, это не инквизиция, а вся идея создания второго мозга заключается в создании системы, которая сделает эту работу за вас сейчас, как мы это делаем, это искусство управления личными знаниями или практика, в зависимости от того, как вы на это смотрите.

Ряд людей в сообществе заявили, что им не нравится это название, но с тех пор я пришел к нему, потому что я  Я также был в той лодке, где я не хотел относиться к своим знаниям как к проекту, и в более раннем видео я говорил о создании цифрового сада знаний, и действительно, некоторые из этих мнений все еще актуальны. Я не думаю, что нам следует все рассматривать как  проект и относимся к себе как к роботу, занимающемуся саморазвитием, но тем не менее мы действительно можем помочь себе, создавая эффективные системы. Я также очень рад, что потратил так много времени на создание этого видео, потому что изначально оно было бы посвящено одному приложению.  Я создаю второй мозг в журнале поиска, но я пришел к выводу, что создание второго мозга - это не приложение, а система приложений, то, как они работают вместе и как вы взаимодействуете с приложениями, так что за последние несколько лет T  присоединился к

Для меня важная идея заключается в том, чтобы сравнить ссылку и действие, и почему я теперь так доволен этим, тогда мы собираемся перейти к захвату. Глубокое погружение, которое является  Затем мы организуем обзор, который является буквой O, а затем

Это может показаться странным, если я делаю видео о поиске журналов Anana, но если вы ищите одно приложение, чтобы управлять ими всеми, это приложение для вас, вероятно, обсидиан. Обсидиан очень мощный, у него много плагинов, и это важная часть, вы можете действительно расширить свои рабочие процессы и, да, настроить его по своему усмотрению, но я смотрел видео Дэнни Хэтчер, который действительно закрепил для меня идею о том, что второй мозг — это не приложение. Если вы знакомы с работами Дэнни, вы знаете, что он король обсидиана или, по крайней мере, один из королей, их несколько, и в  как он строит видео второго мозга, он говорит о том, что это не одно приложение, он использует обсидиан для своих заметок, ноль для своих ссылок, а затем Морган для своего календаря и задач, поэтому, несмотря на то, что вы можете делать все на обсидиане, это не означает, что  вам следует делать все в обсидиане, на самом деле это может 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=217)~~  немного усложнить вашу жизнь, и то же самое касается меня и поиска журнала, попытка сделать все в поиске журнала или способность делать все в поиске журнала теоретически возможны, просто намного больше  сложно выполнить хорошо, поэтому мой второй мозг построен преимущественно с использованием поиска по журналам и T, но я также использую всеядность и проверки для перемещения информации, поэтому, прежде чем мы перейдем к моей системе в целом, давайте посмотрим, как на самом деле вы собираетесь создавать  второй мозг, поэтому процесс кода — это методология Тьяго Форте о том, как мы управляем информацией, а C в коде — это захват, захват — это то, куда мы идем и сохраняем информацию в нашем втором мозге, и Тьяго рекомендует использовать прочитанные позже приложения, чтобы мы не были завалены информацию и необходимость постоянно принимать решения о том, куда мы хотим пойти и что хотим прочитать, но здесь вы используете приложение «Прочитать позже», чтобы вы могли сознательно вернуться к этой информации позже, другой аспект здесь — это просто 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=278)~~  возможность быстро захватить  заметка, поэтому, если вы в пути и хотите просто написать заметку, у вас будет под рукой приложение для заметок, чтобы вы могли очень легко вводить свои мысли и не забывать их, окей, это C, это действительно  собирать ключевые идеи, а не всю информацию, которую вы читаете, хотя некоторые люди так и делают, но я не думаю, что это лучший способ сделать это. мне нравится, чтобы это было очень просто, я просто использую теги, да, хэштеги и ссылки, и когда я использую это в ch, я добавляю к этому немного структуры с помощью полей, но на самом деле он пытается сохранить это таким, чтобы оно было свободным и гибким.  Я не пытаюсь построить эту жесткую иерархию, чтобы я мог найти абсолютно все, чтобы все имело свое место, это на самом деле похоже на поиск мысленных связей, а не на эту жесткую иерархию папок. D - это дистилляция, дистилляция означает, как вы знаете, Bubble Up The Core идеи и сделайте их доступными для себя. Тьяго говорит о прогрессивном реферировании, когда вы просматриваете 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=343)~~  основные моменты, например, в книге, которую вы читаете, а затем постепенно выделяете наиболее важные части, а затем гипотетически даже выделяете их с помощью маркера уценки в журнале, ищите ключевые части, чтобы  что вы можете очень легко пойти и найти их снова, а также перетасовать их таким образом, чтобы это было полезно для вас. E означает «Выразить», а « выражение» - это то, где вы публикуете эти мысли или делаете их доступными для других, чтобы создать ценность для себя.  теперь, если вы не работаете в этой области, или у вас нет дополнительного канала на YouTube, или вы не ведете блог, или что-то в этом роде, последние два могут показаться немного лишними, и я действительно могу с вами согласиться, я думаю  Тьяго сказал бы, что если вы что-то выделяете и выражаете это, это может иметь форму контрольного списка, например, когда вы можете узнать, что касается вашей работы, вернитесь к этому контрольному списку, так что речь не всегда идет о том, что вы обязательно публикуете что-то, но я думаю, что для  у большинства работников умственного труда у нас

Это идея, когда вы собираете информацию.  вам нужно решить, осуществимо ли это или нет, задайте себе вопрос, осуществимо ли это, если нет, оно попадает в вашу справочную систему, если ему нужно изменить форму, тогда оно попадает в ваше приложение для заметок, и там вы все перетасовываете, и да 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=461)~~  разберемся в этом позже по ходу дела, если нет, то оно попадет в ваше файловое хранилище. Теперь вашим файловым хранилищем может быть один диск или любая другая система, которую вы используете, и я хочу подчеркнуть здесь, что это не идеальное правило, поэтому, например, когда вы используете  PDF-файлы. Когда я использую PDF-файлы, я на самом деле помещаю их в журнал поиска, какое мое приложение для заметок вы можете поместить в свое хранилище файлов, если вы управляете изображениями, если вы фотограф или кто-то, кому вы определенно хотите иметь хранилище файлов  система, и вы собираетесь изменить форму тех, кто использует Photoshop, так что это не универсально. Я просто пытаюсь синтезировать то, что я из нее извлек, и, надеюсь, подкину вам несколько идей, окей, в отношении практических действий, которые вам затем нужно будет  спросите, есть ли компонент времени, если он не входит в ваше приложение для управления задачами, если есть, он попадает в ваш календарь, так что там вы снова запланируете его там, не совсем, ну, разграничение здесь 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=516)~~  не идеально для меня, потому что я могу указать время  компоненты в Тоне, так что это мешанина этих двух вещей, но на самом деле это два полушария вашего мозга, о которых можно говорить о полушариях, это действенно и справочно, и для меня большая часть моего внимания в последние несколько лет была сосредоточена на справке.  сторона вещей, особенно в приложении заметок, просматривая журнал, искать информацию, организовывать ее, чтобы я мог снова ее просмотреть позже, и именно здесь действительно помогает иметь хорошую систему, потому что, когда вы решаете проблему, для которой вы просматривали информацию  прежде чем вы проведете какое-то исследование, прежде чем вам не придется возвращаться в Google, повторите всю работу, найдите те поисковые запросы в Google, найдите ту статью, в которой вы уверены, что прочитали, все это в вашей системе, к которой вы можете вернуться позже, так что теперь мы  приступаем к захвату. Глубоко погрузимся, и я поместил это на диаграмму Lucid, чтобы поделиться им с вами. Ссылка будет в 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=572)~~  описании видео, и вы увидите, что это просто просмотр первой части кода, который захватывает.  и я показываю здесь определение того, что является эталоном, а что действенным, поэтому давайте перейдем к справочной стороне. Первая часть - это личное письмо, и я говорю об этом в своем курсе, но я действительно хорошо об этом думаю, я на самом деле думаю о захвате в четырех вещах другой - это внешний ввод, который является четвертым, так что первый - это свободная форма мышления и письма, так что в основном, если я веду промежуточный журнал путешествий, ведение пулевого журнала, или если я просто делаю наблюдения по ходу дела, например  быстрая мысль, я внес это в журнал, ищу в своих ежедневных журналах, почему этот логотип Tana хорошо виден там, когда я в пути. Я думаю, что у Tana есть отличное приложение для захвата, поэтому я просто быстро записываю голосовую заметку и расшифровываю ее, которую я  об этом говорилось в другом видео, поэтому иногда я использую T в качестве посредника, но все равно все сохраняется 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=633)~~  в журнале. Найдите второй момент: мышление и письмо на основе проекта, поэтому, если у меня есть записи совещаний, блокнот проекта, где я просто говорю о разных  идеи и конкретизация вещей, которые также входят в ежедневный журнал поиска журналов, а также отправная точка ежедневных журналов, а затем создание справочного банка, поэтому документация или полезные фрагменты, которые нужно запомнить, также входят в ежедневный журнал поиска журналов, а иногда это также использует снимки экрана, гм, но здесь мы видим эти внешние  входные данные и пойдем сюда. На самом деле у меня есть снимок экрана, который показывает, что я использую snagit, поэтому я использую snagit, который представляет собой инструмент для захвата экрана или экрана, но он все равно переходит в поиск по журналам, поэтому создаю справочную информацию. Сохраните некоторую документацию, которую я могу взять  текст, я могу скопировать и вставить его в поиск журнала, или я могу просто сделать снимок экрана и вставить этот снимок экрана в поиск журнала 2, теперь этот

Я вручную добавляю их в omnivore, поэтому omnivore - это приложение, которое читается позже, многие люди используют readwise в качестве читателя, я не использую  Мне не очень нравится Reader, потому что он экспортирует все как страницу, и мне нравится, чтобы мои страницы были зарезервированы для более высокого уровня информации, чтобы вы могли видеть здесь. У меня есть это всеядное, как вы его называете, расширение для браузера, и я могу просто быстро щелкнуть по нему  или скажите «поделиться всеядным», а затем он переходит в «всеядный». Затем я читаю « всеядный» или читаю во «всеядном», у которого есть свое собственное приложение, а затем импортирую это на страницу импорта всеядного в журнале, ищу, окей,

Я не делаю этого так часто, как раньше, поэтому это не имеет особого значения в моем рабочем процессе, а затем PDF-файлы также загружаются в мои ежедневные журналы, а также просто  для загрузки косой черты идет PDF-файл, но здесь вы можете видеть, что PDF-файл получает свою собственную

Журнал search делает это автоматически. Мне не нужно беспокоиться о том, что следующая часть - это мои основные моменты Kindle, поэтому, когда я делаю аннотации на Kindle, они переходят в режим чтения и чтения, а затем экспортируются на отдельную страницу теперь для книги, которую я не делаю.  действительно против, потому что тогда туда попадает много информации, и я могу ее перетасовать, но для каждой статьи, которую я читаю, если у меня есть один небольшой момент или что-то в этом роде, я не хочу, чтобы это получало отдельную страницу, это должно быть  просто зайдите в журнал, так что еще раз, здесь мне нравится сначала использовать этот ежедневный журнал, а затем, когда нужно что-то улучшить или когда я могу их выделить и выразить, тогда я перемещаю их на отдельные страницы, хорошо, так что это все доступно для меня в журнале  искать

Все управление моими проектами происходит в Tana, потому что я отслеживаю задачи в t, поэтому имеет смысл выровнять все, что вы знаете, по этой иерархии, поэтому  все это попадает в T, и я точно знаю, где оно находится, и могу найти его снова, используя супертеги. T также имеет очень хорошие запросы и очень хороший поиск, так что со стороны захвата это действительно высокий уровень того, что происходит для  я, как я уже сказал, я также использую приложение T capture, а затем перемещаю вещи из своего почтового ящика в журнал, поиск для долгосрочного хранения, который мы сейчас говорим об организованном, и об организованном можно сказать так много, что это

Я получаю много вопросов, как мне реализовать парах в поиске по журналам. Я собираюсь поговорить об этом сейчас, так что парах - это организационная аббревиатура, обозначающая создание второго мозга, поэтому, когда вы хотите что-то организовать  Тьяго говорит об организации действий, и это четыре вещи, области проектов, ресурсы и архивы. Проекты — это вещи, у которых есть срок выполнения и четкая цель, результат — это вещи с постоянной ответственностью, поэтому давайте подумаем о проекте, извините, выпустите, это видео могло бы быть проектом, но это  может быть, вы знаете, что проект можно получить на работе, есть четкие области результатов, такие как финансы, где это похоже на постоянные обязанности, они никогда не закрывают ресурсы, может быть, вы знаете, что ваши книги, 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1097)~~  которые вы читаете, журнальные статьи в формате PDF, все эти вещи могут быть архивами ресурсов  это вещи, или проекты, или, может быть, области, которые больше не активны, и поэтому вам не нужно активно ими управлять. Это было построено с учетом типичной иерархической структуры папок, тем не менее, все равно полезно использовать эту разбивку, когда вы думаете о  как вы можете структурировать свою систему, но вам не обязательно жестко использовать эту иерархию. Прелесть современных приложений в том, что они обладают мощными возможностями связывания и поиска, а поиск по журналам со свойствами и T с полями дают вам много возможностей и гибкости.  добавить метаданные, чтобы разбить вашу информацию на кусочки по-разному, хорошо, и, как я уже сказал, вероятно, это не лучшая идея изначально пытаться реализовать эту структуру папок, но вы можете взять некоторые уроки, каковы некоторые из этих советов высокого уровня  ну, для проектов я бы посоветовал использовать свойства страницы, чтобы вы могли использовать пространства имен, но я не 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1164)~~  предпочитаю этого. Я отхожу от пространств имен для организации, потому что это довольно жестко и иерархично, и я считаю, что позже нелегко переориентировать вещи, так что в целом я  Я отхожу от них, поэтому для T вы можете просто использовать проект с хэштегом, и это создает базу данных, по существу, всех ваших проектов для областей T, это то же самое, что и блог, ищите то же самое, так что вы можете сказать, что у меня есть область  финансов, и тогда я мог бы сказать, что это типичная область, поэтому типом будет свойство, а затем я бы использовал площадь в качестве значения этого свойства, это всего лишь один из способов сделать это для ресурсов, когда я ввожу данные в журнал, ищу я'  Я использую шаблоны, которые используют свойства блока, хотя когда это книга, она использует свойства страницы, так что именно так я добавляю метаданные. Я не собираюсь добавлять хэштег, хэштег книги, хэштег автора, тема, все это в свойствах, поэтому оно систематизировано и красиво, а затем T вы  гипотетически может иметь супертег ресурсов хэштега, который

Итак, уменьшая масштаб еще раз, я просто хочу быстро взглянуть на четыре инструмента, которые у меня есть в этом рабочем процессе захвата, и он всеяден для чтения.  log search и T, поэтому я хочу быстро подчеркнуть основные преимущества этих различных приложений, поэтому log search в некотором смысле по-прежнему остается первым любителем, он имеет открытый исходный код и бесплатен, что является огромным преимуществом для многих людей, он также доступен в автономном режиме, поэтому  он 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1292)~~  работает с локальными файлами, и это, вероятно, следует добавить туда. Это настоящий план, поэтому очень легко перемещать вещи, что отлично подходит для извлечения идей, и вы знаете, просто перетасовываете все, все мои сценарии все еще выполняются в журнале, ищите, это очень легко, и да, как я  скажите, что гибкость тегов превосходна. Я все еще думаю о том, как сделать видео, в котором рассматриваются теги и супертеги, если вы заинтересованы в этом, пожалуйста, оставьте комментарий ниже, ну или да, может быть, есть какие-либо другие предложения, вам нравятся растения?  Я держу растения, мне они очень нравятся. Думаю, это должно было быть немного раньше, но я собираюсь оставить это здесь. Большую часть информации, которую, по вашему мнению, вам нужно запомнить, вы на самом деле можете забыть, и это красота логики, потому что она просто идет туда, и ей не нужен супертег, она должна быть хорошо структурирована или что-то в этом роде, вам не нужно обрабатывать все, если у вас есть только один концептуальный тег или обратная ссылка, по которой вы можете найти эту 
 - ~~[▶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbL4b50fGkM&t=36s&t=1347)~~  информацию  опять же, это все, что вам нужно. У меня есть подход с метаданными, тот, который мне нравится систематизировать мои свойства, и я дам ссылку на видео, это просто способ убедиться, что я получил как можно больше деталей, чтобы  если я ищу видео этого человека, я могу триангулировать и очень легко найти эту информацию с помощью фильтров, окей, моя следующая любовь — Стефани Т. Мне очень нравится T. Пользовательский интерфейс быстрого захвата потрясающий, как будто просто быстро получить что-то с моего телефона, транскрипция AI с использованием  прошепчите API, отлично. Это действительно хорошо для структурирования вещей, поэтому, если вам нужно что-то структурировать, например, что-то в фреймворке или вашем проекте, и да, вы хотите, чтобы это было повторяемо, и все запросы отображались, и все запросы обновлялись, когда вы  обновить один запрос в шаблоне или в теге. Супертег T отлично подходит для этого. Очень рекомендую. Я немного рассказал об этой мощной интеграции с искусственным интеллектом, над которой они

Другое дело, что вы можете снова настроить рабочие процессы импорта. Вероятно, мне следовало написать все это здесь, и для меня это действительно круто, я не сделал  Я не нашел, что я мог бы сделать это также с помощью readwise, и последнее, что касается omnivore, это то, что он экспортируется в виде блоков, что
